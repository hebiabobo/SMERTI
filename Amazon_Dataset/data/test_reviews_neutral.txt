not as expected . no noticeable change in skin . rather gassy side effect . very sweet . tolerable . yet undesireable side effects . won't purchase again .
they are okay i got them for a gift for someone and they seem to like them . they look nice
a very basic presentation of ideas and illustrations . good for brain storming and showing to others to unlock their creativity
painfull to use at first but it does the job if you stick with it .
this was a fun read but a little unbelievable . as a frequent atlantic city visitor , i found some non realistic descriptions .
beautiful shoe ! the left shoe felt like it was stretched . had to put an insole in the left shoe .
the episodes my wife enjoys watching frozed . afraid to reorder part for fear it will happen again which sucks .
does a good job of picking up dust and dirt . you can wash and dry it . it's pretty . i like it .
i found this item to be very useful . it is a well balanced knife that retains its sharpness .
the book eventually began to feel as monotonous as her hike . i wanted more graceful introspection and less step by step narration .
i was very excited to order these . i am dissapointed they are sooo thin and very brittle . also have a weird smell
neither good or bad , i was a bit disappointed in this album , it is not what i expected .
had i known how much work this was putting together , i would have spent more to get an adirondack locally .
does nothing .
this item didn't work well with my husbands phone wish it did cause the film had a nice color . mixed
the stone was plastic not a real stone . ring is nice great fit but was disappointed in the plastic stone .
too much money for a chapstick

great product , good quality , and sturdy . lousy instructions . the instructions made no sense , had to use the picture to build .
the color and the texture are very nice . it's very protective . the corners start peeling of after a while tough .
this is a decent monitor , but has a baseline background buzz that some people find difficult to tolerate .
small ship but nice to see hot wheels making star trek items . glad i have it in my possession . thanks
battery only lasted about hr then died , but my cat really loved it before the light started fading .
works fairly well to remove castor oil and it's better than other products ! i didn't use the castor oil much !
did not hold my attention for long . did not finish it
this is expressionist painting made into a book . so very pleasant and refreshing . to read leisurely .
i bought this as a gift . it arrived when promised . it appears to be everything that they wanted
good
they were good and comfortable and stuff yeah . i wore them all the time when i was out side working .
was a little too shear for me and a could have been a little heavier
fun game , but way too many pop ups each time you quot enter quot the restaurant ! costly decorations , but good menu variety . addictive !
the case does not close properly after sometime of use . i would recommend the product tho because of its cheapness .
its really cute . however it is a bit smaller than i thought , which makes it hard to see the detailing .
egg cutter works well but not on jumbo eggs , extra large are a challenge too . i would buy it again .
it was okay . eddie's dialect seemed a little much for this day and age . otherwise , it was a good read .
it's ok . too much technical stuff . not enough action . never seen so much chuckling , chortling , and snorting . wazzzuup with that .
i was hoping it would be comparable to afternoon tapestry which is scripture to song love it ! .
i enjoyed all the stories very much . penney was fun to read . i recommend this book . to any movie fan .
handy when you wear a wig and need to keep the edges of your hair colored , around your face , etc .
this case didn't fit well and it turned yellow in color after only a few days . would not recommend it
this is a fun book , but the print and the box are too small . otherwise i really enjoy using it .
the fan is kinda loud but works great
i mean it was just ok . the concealer could be a tad bit thicker . it's really thin ! that's all
i could not make myself like this album as much as i liked chaurasia's other cds .
i thought their would be a recipe in the book to do . the story was pretty good not our favorite
characters are likable . great value for a decent , easy read from kindle . a bit predictable , but a good summer read .
maybe if this product was larger i'd like it . its hard to breathe in and gives you a major wegie .
good set of tools for the handyman . not really good for the professional . they are good for my needs though
good cover . pros it's prettycons a little heavy and should have some strap or straps holding the device at the borders .
my grandkids are not good about keeping their cell phones charged and this was the perfect solution for them . thanks
pretty awesome ! not very protective and picks up dirt
the shoe is attractive and stylish . however , it fits a little big . i should have ordered a half size down .
the makeup brush holder is much smaller in reality than it appeared online , but it does hold alot of brushes .
fits great , but the more you do the more it tends to ride up . get it when it's on sale .
it's not the best but i'm still using . when you go cheap you get cheap .
it's okay very nice but doesn't look like the picture . was very disappointed looks nothing like the picture
stool dont stay steady and they are always loose had to buy better stools . nice table . stool not worth it .
i was not very pleased with this item . i expected the bear that sang happy nappers this one did not
its an ok movie

we never received this item from the original order , and re ordered it in december , . elanders
look's great . not an official weight . very light . ok for play but not for a real game .
strap broke after a couple weeks of use , but i was able to sew it back on .
nothing more to say , other than the ease of buying it and overall cost compare to a local store . good !
good story . nice tie in with philosophy of life and isshinryu and martial arts . one ill keep in my library
was not clearly labeled as pocket dictionary . it is very condensed , with just the bare translation into the other language .
i didn't realize just how 'flat' these boots really were . having platar faciitis made it impossible for me to wear them .
i enjoy this game , but needs better tiles to choose from . tiles are boring , needs more pizazz
i did not have the right device to get results from the chromecast my notebook computer would not recognize it .
this stone is a rather odd color . it's a dark forest green and almost looks like a color change stone .
didn't last long . price is good but it should click longer . great idea though and super for boys' batting practice .
it was a good book . a bit like fifty shades , but not as good . some editing mistakes but not many .
thought this book was going to be a little more detailed . it is an ok book , expected more . thank you .
this ring is really cute n sparkly i just wished it was a little thinner . i would buy another one .
i'm waiting for the android . upgrade for mi samsung galaxy s . bluetooth low energy ble devices are not yet compatible !
not the color in the photo ! other than that small detail the case was great and very durable ! i recommend
good game , some challenging areas if i want them .
this movie had practically no action . it was just the love story . that's all i have to say sorry .
i could not find my size , there were only choices for the size . they were not my size .
it is what it is , just ok except for one or two cuts , which were better . just not all that impressed .
the hydrogel pads cools upon contact , however , the cooling sensation dissipates rapidly . i only wish the cooling sensation lasted longer .
feels cheap plastic after all . rough feeling action . somewhat sudden sweep . basically does what a volume pedal should do , though .
worked well
meh . dissolute characters . way too long for no reason . just couldn't get into it .
not much padding in the strap but the strap is solid and easy to adjust . would like more color options
played well until i uninstalled to redo all my progress . overall it was a great game until our little problem .
it is more of a dress
this is the book you read while waiting to find a good book . this is not the author's . best work
very good case people love it lots of compliments check out my video on this item on youtube rslaborde thanks
liked answers to the exercises at the back of the book . disliked cd rom wasn't fully functional in my vista setup .
i wish the book wasn't written as a diary entry form . i didnt feel like i was reading a book
a nice , enjoyable book , however it will not be joining my shelf of keepers to be reread .
i really didn't care for this type of app . i have removed this app from my device for this reason .
obviously cheaply made shoe . bought them for an aerobics class . they are only very slightly better than my running shoes .
its ok if you have nothing better to do . at first the idea is novel . it get a little old .

started ameal months ago haven't noticed any difference in my blood pressure readings yet . maureen
very nice dress and material , but very difficult to zip up in the back . other than that loved the dress !
i choose this rating , because i have not purchased this set yet . cost to much , waiting for a lower price .
i like the game , keeps the mind working and challenging . it just needs better access doesn't always open for me .
its ok . i put it on like the instuctions recommended but after awhile it started to peel in a corner .
has everything , love , guns wealth , romance and deception . it starts slow but gets good after one hundred pages . loved it .
they work ok but seems like a little short on the ink .
the first two songs are amazing !
this was a sexy nice and light book to read . i liked the storyline getting trapped in the elevator . enjoyable
no flash support for the kindle units . a lot of videos will not play because they are flash based . please correct
connector is very brittle and will crack when stepped on . this causes a leak or breaks loose altogether . not good .
this was an unnecessary expense . there was no info in the book that was not in the free instruction book .
tedious . why do pastiche authors feel they have to spotlight dr . watson ?
the two shams mentioned in the description were not included . that took away from the presentation . i returned the set .
to slow . good casting for the movie . everytime i thought it was now reving up it would not get going .
this was not the best book i have ever read but it was okay to pass the time
hose conection works well . doesn't draw things in as well as i would like .
great idea , but , the cable clamps included were faulty . had to go to the hardware store to get better clamps .
will not buy this again , although the bristles are soft and very efficient .
good historical read great insight into the man and to the times back then . would recommend to anyone . cheers
not enough to last
good read for a rainy afternoon . the author does a good job making the setting seem appropriate , and fairly accurate .

it grows on you .
rec . in timely fashion unit in good cond . dosen't heat up as hot as i thought it wouldwould recommend

the story started out slowly . it picked up suspense and interest as it went on . it was an okay read .
one hundred clean , unbroken microscope slides and square covers , what in the world else can i say about the slides ?
it work great
it's too smooth in flavor yet the after taste or feeling in throat is dry . remember not tobacco is molasses
recieved and planted . germinated . has not done much yet .
it was broken on the side where the belt goest through , and the label with care instructions are not in english
it was fine . it work like it should . there is nothing more to be said . yes i would buy again
the book is informative but written for young children . i thought it would be more for older children of adults .
not enough details such as actual email address and websites for , say , buying realty . like agents , etc . etc . etc . etc .
fun kids show for tweens . my daughter who is , loves selena gomez so this was a hit at our house .
unfortunately , i do not feel strongly enough one way or the other to type more than the required twenty words .
good product . it was a bit too small for me though . i recommend this product to all . visca bara !
this hasn't really done anything for me . i really wanted it to work , but there isn't any miracle cures out there .
it's ok , doesn't hold me in as much as i would like

i'd like the darkest coffee possible , and this seems about the same as the less expensive dark pods .

it's ok . i hope this unit can last for at lease years or more i hope it has warranty .
i received the book relatively quickly , but it wasn't in as good condition as advertised .
this book makes the game so much easier . knowing what to expect on each mission helps tremendously .
the knives i received were not pointed the knives aresharp and attractive yes but not pointed as stated
was not really for large head but is ok for price was a little smaller than i thought would be

kind of small and uncomfortable .
small convenient and practical . remember the battery will last one year . not extraordnary but convenient for taping seminars or so .
it was okay if you like medical thrillers . too much detail to be very thrilling though .
the company shown bioaire , these are not bioaire they are made by another manufacture and seem good but are mislabeled
i say it's okay as i haven't read the book yet . how can i give you an honest opinion ? wait .
they were just okay would of know what they really were and how they were made would on not bought
i should have read the directions first but not the clearest . it's tough though . i may make the purchase again .
it's a fun book . but please be aware this is not a children's book . very adult content . rated r .
the battery doesnt last as long as the factory battery . but it is cheap so .
it is fun to play , and it does work well , and i like that can unlock more boards and tokens .

would have preferred more songs , and wish the franchise would offer more contemporary songs more often .
not a whole lot of susbtance . felt like readiing a short story . a pleasant enough read , but not too deep .
wasn't as dark as i would have liked , but the tint was sufficient . all in all it was just ok
nuts fit like oem . tried other nut from local hardware store , but they protruded further than this nut .

this games is ok i like it ffffffffff fffffffff fffff ffffff ffffuuuu uuuuuuu uuu uuu uunn nnn nnnnn nnnnn game
i like it
with an interesting premise and enough detail to be realistic . a little shallow in places but still a fun read .
it takes much too long to charge and there were no instructions of any kind .
but for my personal taste the case size is too big and the overall weight of the watch is uncomfortable .
pretty mindless but action packed .
it okay
funny movie . especially the network anchor rumble . some clever stuff . its a good rent .
not the greatest read , especially if you know the justice system and how it works . would not recommend this book

just like old times , just smaller than i expected .

i was not mine so i do not know how it was . all i can say is it was ok .
cable is too short
i dealt like it one of you just hats it its notso bad ! just try it ! oh come on
not for average people with limited money to start a small business .
enough to carry ya mobile
voice quality was very poor . i had keep playing with the volume through out the movie , which was very frustrating .
works alright
classic s ! i actually think the second one is better , but both movies are a good watch .
ok book . mystery was a little to easy to guess . but i liked it . it's a good book to read .
should have been a magazine article instead of a book . too short and not really inspiring or of great interest .
the rubber liner ripped putting it on but i got it to fit , so it will do ok for now
i was upset that u can only play one level before you have to upgrade . hfnb yygjh . jhghhhc highhg g
perfect for what it's suppose to do pump air into the mini basketball . it arrived broken but it'll do
it lost its color and peeled off . looked rough after about weeks of use . shipping was accurate on no hassle .
average quality . not good for gifting . it's just like a bowling pin starw . plastic material is not so great for water . thanks
great book
i really like it very challenging but continues to freeze up if they could fix that i would love it .
received chargers and only one works
this book is very boring to me . it reminds me of a college book report . it is a fast read . very disappointing .
this has an acquired taste .
my life's been a country songthis is a very good cd . it reminds me of his earlier releases .
the premise is pretty far fetched and the characters aren't very believable . the action is strained with too many miracles
not super accurate because it rounds the numbers . but overall its ok because it does the job .
having trouble getting my dish anywhere to recognize my iphone hotspot when not at home .
they're not the best quality .
i guess i thought this would be more visually engaging and have paged through not fully reading it through yet .
at first i was like . wait what is this about . it is rushed . in a way i still like it .
highly readable , somewhat predictable . a fast , fun summer read .
not pretentious , easy to watch with smooth pacing . production values are good . would have liked the option of spanish subtitles .
good story but too long and redundant
haven't used this product long enough to get any results . check back later . i really hope this works for me .
i love the case but it was a little small , finally got it on my phone ! but now it's good !
it was start of second year , so i wanted to see if i had interest in season two . it's ok .
very cute cell phone case yet it was definitely made pretty cheaply . it broke quickly ! i was very dissappointed ! '
i thought it would retain my city weather report , but the second time i checked , i could not find it .
it broke the same day i recieved it . they are very cheap plastic . but i did get it very quickly
no doubt a great book , but unfortunately the audio book version is not sold in my geographical region the netherlands .
i ordered a new product , but to me it is a used , there are obvious signs of use . with a well .
i found that this book was too wordy and could have been written more concisely . i did appreciate the techniques .
pretty much the same thing as the original that it replaced .
its cheap and it fixes the broken screen . color and quality though is not the greatest .
this is totally personal preference . it works as advertised and quality made . i just didn't like the feel of it .
i thought i was ordering a remote for my zune radio , got the wrong item , my bad
the story is dark , but fascinating . makes technology for kids really scary ! a good read for parents of young teens .
i was hoping for a better performance from the blades . that is why i inly gave ti a three rating
these flowers are ok . they look more like indigo , a very dark purple . but am gonna use them any way .
very good story , but sad . how well do we know our friends and neighbors ? be a friend to someone today .
i guess you get what you pay for , hopefully the cases will actually benefit the protection of the phone itself .
this is a relatively useful tool for the preparation of beans'n frank's . it slices frank's in uniform , presentable slices . so .
the sound quality was good and transmit good . surveillance kit stopped working after three weeks . no obvious broken wires found .
they were better before . they are not as thick now and come individually wrapped which makes them wasteful .
its not as sturdy as i hoped it would be .
does not get hot enough and takes too long to get warm at all . i would not buy this again .
dragged out at end . a tough editing would have garnered more stars .
so this is a zombie movie , well if it is wasn't done very well and makeup not great either so
very durable and its exactly what i thought it would be ! and it wasn't expensive ! great product . i love it !
a little thin but seems to do the job it was meant to . the price was right for the product .
say you will is a good read . i look forward to reading the other books in the summerhill book series .
thin fabric t hope it doesn't wear out quickly which is what i was trying to avoid . otherwise it fine .
love the game . just don't like to use gold coins to upgrade .
eh it was alright it wasn't great but it was eh . never wanna read this book again in my life
nice but made more for teenagers to early twenties . not cheap , just a younger look and light weight . blah blah
time crisis is good but it doen't come with a gun .
enjoying it
was more than pleased with this item , and made a wonderful gift for a young girl who loves dolphins ty
a way to jump start or re spark your poetry . long lists of ideas to cajole the dull or defiant muse .
historically this is very very 's in a very kitschy and endearing way . not anything more unfortunately
the story was a good one , but i found so many typos and copy editing errors that it was distracting .
the lace part of the shoe is too long and does not stay up when you tie it . keeps falling down .
it's a good children's movie . my son enjoyed it and got sone laughs out of it . it's a good classic .
i ordered a size m and it looks like an xs i've to return it because it really doesn't fit !
works ok with this price .
having to pay for this short story , i enjoy baldacci as a writer but feel taken by paying for this .
it kinda works
the popcorn is good , but it is low calorie by being a very small serving .
pretty dress however extremely low cut and not for women with breasts bigger than a a !
cute , but a bit cheaply made and willnot likely hold up . fold out trays are nice and useful , but flimsy
one of the monogram barney google snuffy smith films . the alpha print is acceptable with the usual splices , etc .
this bag ripped immediately and i bought the king size for a queen mattress and it barely fit . no bueno .
nothing special , was comical , paul rudd is great in all movies . middle of the pack as far as recent comedies .
the app is good but only getting one coin for each puzzle that you solve is not very much .
it s just like any other vaccum , no big difference from the one that i have before , regular one .
i was really hoping for something so much better than what i received . it just looks really cheap to me .
not nearly as tasty as i remember from when i was a teenager .
unconditional love , passion , heartbreak , friendship , drama , lots of sex . this book has it all . have tissues on hand while reading
it was somewhat predictable and the ploy of the future revelations' was totally unrelated to the plot .
the story line is good but it was a chore to read . poor editing , misspellings and other errors are common .
not a true size they were tight . i have pair of size d . i know what i wear
not exactly what i was expecting . it was only about inches tall of smaller , but she loved it anyways .
wished xl size existed . my hat slides up my head and i begin to look like a gnome . good attempt .
it's ok
this has very simple recipes for busy people on the go . i always love pictures so the more the better .
it didn't really hold my son's interest though he was very excited seeing it in a store .
good
recently being diagnosed with celiac , this is very helpful in making breads which is an important part of our lives .
it is good for what the author sets out to do , but it could have been so much more .
works fine doesn't take out odors like id like but it takes out wrinkles pretty well for a compact steamer
noisy when breaking but they work . if you're on a budget get them , otherwise look for something a little better .
i like there products , wanted to try it out , not bad , but nothing special . worth the money .
i wish there wasn't so much highlight points already because these points are not areas i need to focus on .
this dvd arrived very promptly in excellent condition . however , i have not had time to watch it . soon
the product works as advertised but not overly impressive . would recommend it to others but don't expect too much from it
the only thing it's missing is a cover for the front so that part doesn't get scratched . otherwise , very nice product .
not at all what i expected . very short strand and not as large as i'd hoped . but they are ok
start with stings of unconscious . this is good hard core metal music , but not as good as their earlier work .
small . supposed to be plus sized but not . x fits like a large maybe . print isn't flattering on curvy legs
the socks were fine , but not quite the quality i was looking for . shall use them though . thank you very much
nice for the price , even though one of the tips broke off after a couple of uses . they are nice .
okay , but not great . not enough variety in items and locations . after awhile it is boring . i need more challenges .
at the same time , as very heavy , they are rather bulky and they did not fit well on my doors
too small . thought the product was going to be bigger
very convenient but does require good hand washing to clean properly . for this reason alone i am rating stars .
romina power is interesting to watch in this flick , but overall , the story needs more help then she can deliver .
always good when it's birdy , but not the best . chorus gets very repetitive . rhythm goes from ballad to fast beat ?
i had expected a regular length novel . i was extremely surprised when it ended where the first chapter would have .
gave to a friend for his bday . he liked it . not sure what it follows although im assuming piranha ?
whyyyyyyyyyy ? i love this premise . how fantastic ! why was it written so badly ?
glad i also bought a ' cable as this is really to short to use on a lot of occasions .
enjoyed it but not enough to read it again .
it is too short . the picture of the product is not the same as the final product .
wraps up the ealier books , but appear to be in a rush to do so . all in all a fun read .
good performances . interesting but not compelling . perhaps i am too familiar with the material and not responsive to the presentation .
does this include a charger ? i am unsure if i have to purchase a charger separately or not . thank you !
have only played a few times but good graphics , quick response time and fun to play . so far so good . easy , too .
doesn't fit right in my hp laptop sd slot . but it works in my camera so i kept it .
not bad for the price . made in china it's sharp and the blade doesn't wiggle n k y h gs
she likes it . there was one song i listened to that was nice . i havent listened to the whole thing
this product is not designed to work as well on plastic tables . have to keep an eye on the clips .
they tend to wear out fast over time and then tear and fall off . will not purchase again in future
i was hoping the screen cover would stick better . it also was not the exact fit needed for my phone .
loved the saying but the print is super small . gave it as christmas gifts to a few of my friends
not bad . i little slow moving plot . very predicable plot . long book !
pretty good not a lot of points given but a really really really good game to play anywhere . overall good
it was an ok book . i would have liked to hear more of the story and less about the bible
i don't know that is it so good . but i feel save when i have it .
not metal as i thought but it works for our needs . not as nice as our cheaper ones either though .
delightful !
an economical alternative to photoshop elements diversity and surprising quality . a very nice gift . great value for money . bravo ! will buy again
works okay . not as well as one i down loaded on my iphone from fingerarts . it will do for now .
one piece of the cord did not work properly upon arrival , but the other piece of the cord worked fine .
i was looking up sweat pants and thought this was what i was getting . don't care much for them actually .
ironically , a rather too heady look at the hand . touches on many aspects of the hand brain connection , in short dense references .
the microfiber fabric is nice , but the towels seems a little on the small side to me .
the bottoms fit well , i had to fix the top to fit me but it was a good buy .
fine
good product the beanie garfield is very cute . dvd is very funny but that's just garfield for you !
perfect size . but too heavy to hang on my beagle very long , it gets too hot .
there are better ones out there to spend your money on . it did get here on time and in conditon .
there are more improved ones out there this is an older model but works .
i like this game out of all the games i have . so if you whant ofrode this is your game
not as good as other kellerman novels , but i always enjoy reading her . i left me wanting a better story .
it's good but a little bigger then i thought . can be very nice if it's smaller and better material
its not the best app in the work but its fun to play with at an all girls party's
the lamp is not nearly as bright as lamps i have purchased in the past . it should be much brighter .
i actually kind of hated this book at first , but it got much better when they told the flashback stories .
sweet taste , few calories but does not sweeten as effectively as other sweeteners . flavor somewhat strong . i will not return .
for those who like such plots , they may enjoy this drama . contains adulterous affairs and some unpleasant twists . three stars .
not bad , serves its purpose so i dont have to lean forward to get my drink while pregnant . no complaints !
rather shallow , and not too impressive . rather wordy and ambiguous , not sure what the author's purpose or point really is .
very beautiful just sad rose lasted a week before falling off but just reglued it . got many compliments on it .
they look ok , however they snag easily if you have pets . its a bandaid until i get the cloth style
not enough info about how to care for them after they bloom like how to trim them , from the plants
fun , but really repetitive . when you get to the upper levels finding the last remaining enemies can be a chore .
it didn't fix the problem , when installed , nothing worked , so at a total loss as to what to do now !
the slippers fit great and are comfortable . i'm a size and ordered . size . i would recommend this product , .
the item i received does not work with the pan i have . i must have mis measured my pan . oh well .
this arborio rice performs poorly . it does not absorb water well and it easily becomes pasty . go for another kind .
hey , what the . ? the cutting mats don't match the recess in the board . all , save one , had to be trimmed
a very cute story with a good mix of magic and adventure . meant for the younger reader but enjoyable to all .
better than season , worse than season . smallville is beginning to lose its charm . great ending though !
these costume beads are really cheap , but for costume wear and the price , it is perfectly fine for the show .
i don't like these chewables as well , and i don't think that they work as well as the tablets .
very much after smoke when dosed out . also the smokesmelled pretty badly . color of candles was appealing a pretty orange
it's very average . if you don't have anything to do , you can watch . its not bad not is it good .
this will look terribly slutty on you if you have big boobs , unless you plan on your nipples popping out .
i don't know if the product works or not .
although i like the product . i don't feel the price is warranted . but then , that's just my opinion . thank you !
the ring circle fell off or broke off but , that's okay it looks great nestled among my plants .
happy there are large eye but others so small won't be able to use
it's nice looking not what i thought , i guess it will do the jod
typical astrology love signs book . skip around to different signs chapters i was interested in and found the standard personality traits .
cheaply made wallet and slightly expensive . however , i love marvel comics so i like it .
ehh , they're alright . not much stick to them though . just like at the salon . it is what it is though .
good info and tips on photographing the bride and groom . very detailed info on general photographing wedding parties . thank you
the straps were too wide for a business suit use imho . i returned them .
it protects well and is easy to remove and put on but it fits way too tight .
what it covers it covers well but for complete knee coverage it is a bit sparse . that is about it .
i though it would be brighter but its ok i guess , great for smaller rooms not living rooms or partys .
it really does nearly eliminate fingerprints . smudges and other stuff though , are another matter . it collects dust like nothing else .
i like it very much . a bigger size would have been more comfortable . will order another .
they are a double e and they are still narrow . not true to sizenice color and velcro but very narrow
yes i liked it it keeps my phone in my hands and doesnt fall out so easily lol but thanks
the case was fine it looked like someone tried to make it coloring was a little bit distorted .
disappointed , was hoping they would be slightly bigger to accommodate a vanilla wafer used as the crust for mini cheesecakes .
i've been using it daily for the past few weeks now , but i don't see much of a difference yet .
it is just what they announce . it fits well in most watches . i recommend it , good price for what you get .
the lids on these aren't as sturdy as the one's i recently purchased from walmart . the metal is somewhat loose .
neither earth shattering or groundbreaking , but a practical , consistent trio of well textured , minimal minded early ep's nonetheless .
cute . but you get what you pay for .
good value
just an ordinary romance book , good enough to read but not anything to yell about i would not buy it .
and you won't be able to put it down , but it becomes a story that we've heard many times before .
its as described , not like the pic though but everything was fine and can be used for my scooter haha
good but only says how long the battery will last and it also works on kindle fire hd very good
it did not last very long and the spin part not particularly effective for brushing the teeth of a toddler .
not alot of bass , dont fit real well on head , feel cheaplong cord is good , price was right , arrived quick
it looks good with the available price and can be affordable . it doesn't look extremely great but not bad either .
this was a gift for my grandson . he was happy with the paper . seems to rip easy . liked all the colors
the book is interesting , but i was hoping for information on field marshall radetzkysince i am a decendent .
my case was broken and it did not tell me that before i bought it , everything else was fine though ,
came on time , no problems . the price was too high for what i got
this book is a reference book for me i've used it a few times and it mostly has been helpful .
only enjoyed a few of the songs
pretty good overall tool though very low resolution so i wouldn't want to rely on this for anything real detailed .
basic guide for use on model if you have a standard . any upgrades and manual really is no help .
this did not fit my phone correctly . phone went in securely , but the various holes did not line up .
light weight . nice that wand can be removed from base for cleaning . feels cheap .
these are cute but awkward . they stick out when you move the curtain , and fall off when moved side to side
velcro wears out quickly .
these are great products . i would have given this one stars if they used anything other than c batteries .
was not that good looking .
i epected too much . too much dettailisl missing , imho . wont know how to come up with you required words here
it's ok .
ehh it was an ok game i guess so yea i like it u would to if u play it
not a bad mystery novel however the move between reality and dream sequences was not really to my personal liking .
i find this doesn't hold as long as other gaffers tape .
i was very disappointed with the sound quality . even with the megabass turnedon it didn't seem to make much difference .
it works pretty well . the only issue is that it's extremely loose and falls if moved . seems to be accurate .
a fun read . a very well paced and entertaining story . an interesting take on the satyr myth .
fun . but it doesn't have it all . very short about hours and very repetitive . almost zero replay value .
a moving story of sacrificial love , injustice , hope for the future and faith in the people you thought were enemies .
je donnerais mon opingion dans un mois lorsque je l'aurais mis en pratique dans un avenir proche . a tres bientot
heavy duty i hope the welds hold up as they do not go fully around the connection .
you can tell its made cheap , but it is does look pretty , but won't protect phone . the design is what sells it .
to young for my son so he doesnt play it so that is all ti have to write about it
the restraint works as promised , but is stiff and is a little awkward for use on a very small dog .
the story was intriguing and fast paced . but it was predictible and left questions unanswered . overall a good read . enjoy .
took awhile to get through this one . and the ending was a bit anti climactic . otherwise still a good read
the highlight here is vedder and his poetic lyricism , but the songs themselves are mostly very short and musically uninteresting .
short but a decent read . doesnt add anything to the zombie genre , but an entertaining read . very short novella . thanks
go back to making good products not having to scam more money out of us to replace locks and hinges .
kevin lehman presents us with a challenge . good book to pick up and read every now and then
medium size , plastic feel strong , with two aa batteries , but soon run out . photo quality is so so , but very cheap .
fun but hard to see things
good book , very interested to see what happens next ! sometimes felt a little rushed but other wise a good read .
it's just a piece of paper . i don't know what we can possibly review on it . it's nice and shiny
the game was pretty much what we expected . worth the money i spent on it . would suggest this to somebody else .
the book was sort of good . the time bomb and the gatling cannon were my favorite traps . they were cool .

just the rather drawn out story of steve martin's lengthy rise to comedy stardom . interesting , but not what i expected .
a book that moves in leaps and bounds at one point and crawls at others . not a bad read overall .
it works as fine but does not last as the original does , and it heats a lot than the original
please delete from my list .
they have electricity better models but they sold me older version . i has a year old model . the gad newer . hmm
nice illustrations . no major changes . very original . good book , it's good for kids and adults . thumbs up to the illustrator .
so far it is just ok . did not quite get to the end but so far it is just ok .

i liked the case however after a few accidental drops the case broke .
it does what i need it to do . i wish the wrinkles were less noticeable . i would buy another one .

good music , will be better if this was with the original artists but for . good
extensions are nice but i was looking for thickness and they are very thin . also more wire like than real .
the manual is nice but thought it would be better . brought it to supplement my library . nice but not spectacular .
biting and searingwritten in if you're white its an angry eye opener
ok deal , and the end product is indistinguishable from a true photo print . but they are expensive and easily damaged .
used this to replace oem camera does not plug in to oem plug however spliced in fine . a good alternative .
action is well paced , characters are intelligent , as is the dialogue . a good , solid sci fi read .
there were some really good recipes for cupcakes in this book . and great way to cut some of the calories .
home run was a good family movie . enjoyed watching the movie . i would recommend for others to see . good movie .
as any parent knows , reading has to be fun for adults , too . this book annoys me a bit . too repetitive .
this item seens to be authentic but it has no feet . overall it's nicely made and soft . true to size
i bought this because i liked it years ago . very , very small bottle and not quite the sent i remember .
rather erratic behavior has occured . do not feel it is giving me an accurate reading . better thah nothing i guess !
sometimes i have to giggle it to make the connections work when plugging it in to the phone and wall .
didn't care for some of the descriptive words . it was too short and not enough suspense . did like the subjects .
surprisingly , the lyrics and melody are kind of boring here . the lyrics in the chorus are sort of generic sounding .
they were all pretty good but it was really just a number of shorts that were in one book .
great sauce but too pricey . if i wasn't desperate , i would have waited until my next trip to tony roma's
did not come with adaptor .
. the picture started to mess up . great picture quality until day three of use . red grainy look to all pictures .
this has always been a fun game . i wanted to try it out so i got the free trial
this is a very basic and simple book . everything you need to know to start up ! good information and understandable .
didn't lose any weight with this product , kind of staying at a plateau
you can't go wrong with mr chow ! plenty of funny spots in this movie . alan is always funny . worth watching
i wish the dev would have added different levels or some kind of progression . game play itself is pretty good .
i have a hard time trying to figure out which control i should use and how much i should use
title meant to lure you in , but once there , take a nap . glad i just watchde it free on prime .
these shoes are very cute , but they run a little small . just a half size bigger would have been perfect
the password does not always work . you have to keep resetting it and my granddaughter takes up set over it .
they are okay guess i was thinking they would be better quality but one gets what they get i guess .
the watch itself is absolutely beautiful , but when it arrived it didn't work . waiting on another one !
it has possibilities and i would watch a few more but i'm not totally sold . writing i thought was weak .
it was slow to get started , but once you get to section it picks up and grabs your attention .
cool boots , but keep in mind sizes are usually size larger than regulas tenis shoes
it's okay it's like playing pool . i guess i just have to play more cause i'm not that into it
good ball but bad packaging
too many hours between mystery quests .
aside from some shrinkage after a couple of washes it's still a pretty good product . purchased in the light pink .
read the description carefully , i didn't realize the product has glitter . my fault .
these are ok , but dont hold a charge like a new phone .
this was a fairly depressing movie ! it was a combination of mad max and what the bible teaches about armageddon .
its okay i would recommend for another purchase , no problem so farproducts is in use great okay fun fact
broke weeks later worked good till then would buy anther one n be more carfull with the next one
it gets old real quick . you just run around smashing things and building things . woopee .
not a big green lantern fan but it was entertaining . kids loved it so for that it gets stars .
pictures could be more detailed but other than that , fun game . it's more or less quick thinking of common sayings
these slipper socks turned out to be useless for my mother . they are small , thin , and the non skid doesn't work .
i was hoping for recipes . ok read . most of this i knew . i need to review reviews better next time around .
battery does'nt stay charged . and when charging it keeps blinking . not happy with this purchase . would like to return for a replacement .
the action in this film is incredible and the acting skills by tobey maguire is excellent . nice writing and direction .
seem to block a lot of uv , but the frames are really flimsy and too small to wear over eyeglasses .
but if you have off road or aggressive tread tires on a truck or jeep they disintegrate during first use .
doesn't seem to work as well for me as it does for others .
i liked the free version and could not install the full version . too bad ! the immersion in visuals seems effective .
the information is ok . my issue is honestly just the quality of paper . its not for keeps all , almost disposable .
it's just ok . painted design is pretty sketchy , and it isn't nearly as nice as it appears in the photo .
ok
what does this book include that warrants a price tag of . ? any better then the others on the market ?
was expecting much more . hose tangles and is a pain to coil back up . i do like the aluminum fittings .
this wasn't some thing too good , acouple hot tracks , but most of it is garbage .
some surprising turns ! kept my interest but not as thrilling as some of baldacci's other books . definitely worth a read
haven't used it much . i don't like the idea of having to purchase hints .
fun story to read , but not a great story .
the hole punched option was a terrible idea ! i went and had it coil bound a fedex office for .
funny , enjoyed the new york scenery , this movie was reminscent ofthe late s early s womens movement .
this was decent light reading book for a vacation nothing too complicated yet enough going on to keep me interested
this was bought as a gift and i was told that they worked just ok . i was hoping for more .
this needs to be on a stretchy band of some sort as the clasp can't be done one handed . pretty though .
dear sir madam , the baby food maker was down now . i think there is one assembly is broken , could you post one to me ?
i didn't really love this book , but it is entertaining and it is very good if you are into mythology .
this item is for the fit and young . i was able to use this but , it made my knees hurt .
its ok . not all that fun . but it would definatly keep a young ones attention for an hour or two
this was supposedly a well rated dictionary . but rarely is the word there when i'm looking for a russian word .
. was way too short . would have been an awesome story if it had been way , way longer . but thank you anyway , it was cute
tight in the hips
i bought this from amazon last month for . , now the price is . . what an inflation !
buena muy entretenida y bien detallado , agradable y faci lectura la historia se desarrolla agradablemente el final es muy bonito
it is a pretty strange story , even by michael palin standards ! but i did find it to be entirely watchable .
price and availability made this a great purchase . book was in great shape and i used it extensively for class .
interesting but not useful to our particular culinary needs . recipes were okay but not exactly the best nutrition for us .
an enjoyable light read containing a nice romance , some historical and a good betrayal of social pedjustes of the time .
i loved the design and style , but way bigger than i thought it would be , just too big for me !
lids are not very goodplastic quality id not good . will not buy same in future .
it's ok better off having them painted it's a much better look . over all a good but but nothing special
to long and a bit contrived . reads like she wanted to make it much longer than it had to be .
strong . almost too strong . but if youngneed to freshen up a place fast , this will do it . worth the price .
its ok , because i thought that was in spanish too . but is not ! anyway , i really like the movie ! !
it met the need but no complaints . i wish it had fit my ipod mini , but will work for me .

not bad , don't have much to say , it a app the let you draw
ok for its purpose . i have nothing further to say but since there are require words . ok for its purpose
works somwhat
this book is nice because there's igloos , bears , ice . also , annie and jack saw a eskimos in the igloo .
great scent , but was a gel stick and my hubby prefers the solid . not sure the product tag mentioned that .
good but most of the time it beeps instead of playing your music and that beep is easily slept through !
no bad , no good . i recommend other options with better quality for the same or little higher price . thanks anyway
the battery life was too short . i would like to speak to some about it please . thank you very much
but not among the best . not enough action ie escapes , cons . it has an obvious sequel , which hopefully is better .
good . i like the product . good charger . good trailer . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good . !
it is kind of flimsy , need to be very careful with it . when hanging , the hanger came out right away .
i got this , put them in the dishwasher and one of them cracked before it was used . not that good .
we have had several of these , they break after a few years . aside from that , it's a great product .
curling iron heats fast , but it takes smaller sections of hair because the barrel is short . it's all right , though .
it did take a couple of applications to get it right . but works as described
mindful is an interesting story . but i thought that it would have been longer . does this book have more chapters ?
dried out in ghe tube after three weeks i only used this item once and threw the tube away .
band to sm .
poor quality of wood , very soft . you have to be careful with set up . carving can split wood . sound is ok
it was an easy read but the book plot was not too exciting to me . not one i'd read twice .
i have to apply twice in a month . after couple of shampoo the color start fading . not to bad either .
i really hoped this bar agreed with me . its nutritional specs are great . but the soy really upset my digestion .
i bought the wrong size tire . i didn't know there were different size tires on weber grills . be aware !
but lacked the intensity of some other novels about the same period . elizabeth chadwick's series about william marshal , for instance .
usb plug easy to loss because of size
they are very cute on . they fit well and are comfortable for the price . they fit well around the ankle
this item is awkward to extend and retract . fiberglass construction a plus . came well packed and overalla good product
pretty , but bristles are too stiff .
too hard . no instruction booklet . what more do you want me to say ? why do you want more words ?
this book did enlighten me to a few new ideas . liked how easy and quick it was to read . thanks !
it is fine for the begginer i am . will probably upgrade once i get into it more .
comfortable , but not as thick a padding as i had hoped for .
the remote had a crack on the side and took over three weeks to get here but it works great
mm is not and th its and th . just thought everybody should know before they order it .
a bit bigger thicker than the original ear pads on my headset but they do the job . cant really complain .
of the three that i ordered , one did not work . the two that did , work well . would probably buy again .
i liked the point of view . a bit too many i s in the book .
i thought was funnier but this is still pretty good . except for august .
the mirrors were ok . i just thought they would be big enough to show a larger view of traffic behind me .
it doesn't have te ability to call , but i guess it will do when i need to talk to someone .
quality was good , movie wasn't as funny as i was told it would be . sound quality was good as well
good high quality small pump . no problem with kids bike tires . i would highly recommend this pump to my friends .
air do come out but only by the hose connection spot , of the area it's no air come out .
but , fabric is very thin you can almost see through it .
what did i expect ? it's just a spider man . i hope there is something else than the main story . nothing special .
perfect factory fit . too bad they rot off in two winters
didn't pay as much as in stores but it wasn't the right fit . does it's job and came on time .
not appropriate language for a yr old . looks appealing to a young person but not appropriate in my opinion .
was not what i expeceted , read book first , maybe that why it seem a little lack luster , book was o . k .
it's the first in the trilogy , but i really cannot understand why fifty shares has become such a cult classic .
great story line , love the characters but the ending fell short for me and the cursing was to in your face
it's a good workout just very very dry . i was just looking for something a little more fun with music .
this book is somewhat outdated , but the principles contained within still apply and are priceless !
not the best out there
it is fragile and i would not trust it to protect the phone in a fall , but it does fit .
loved these headphones until now the leatherette is pealing all off . come on sony , you can do better than this .
annoying book . glad i'm done with writing papers . it is helpful though , just annoying !
like it , but not the original and longer charge
i knew this boot isn't emu australia . however this boot is emu wool . boot's quality is good , but emu wool .
this book is goodnotas good as some i have read . i havemanybooks and read many especially my bible ? god bless
is a good products
smaller than it looked like online . it glows okay but not the most impressive thing i've purchased . x x z
characters not bad . different take on vampires . action good . story good . college life not my age group but good read .
this item seems to be a little bigger than the ones the military issued but the larger size is ok .
worms , pirates , more than fun than poodles . . out of
sole not as soft , thong is stiff . i wore with tabi to break in but still not what i'd hoped
at first these are really good , but after you're done eating them , it leaves a funny taste in your mouth .
this book is just fair . baldacci's older books are much better . i have read most , if not all of them
a good guide for the beginner . lots of good information and resources for someone just starting a new lifestyle change .
very general and no specific pointers . just a few words of encouragement . it's like an article or th grade essay .
what i received was missing a single bit , but it wasn't a size that i absolutely needed , so it's okay .
the taste is average it's a small container you put in tablespoons per serving ! expensive considering the taste bad value
not a gripper , but interesting as how the future may look . a slow read but interesting . need three more words .
this book was okay . i didn't find it gripping by any means . it is moderately interesting .
a quick , light , easy read . nothing earth shaking . just a sweet story . it will make you hungry . good read for foodies .
got it for my kids no trouble with it so far after about month .
book and disc were complete but book had been used with test answers circled and it was advertised as new .
it burns my skin when i sprayed it . so i don't use it , it was a waste of my money !
i have not used the protection plan yet , and hope i do not have to in the future . good price .
its ok but not what i thought it would be . a bit more difficult than i thought it would be .
a good movie for a fan of boris karloff and old time movies . light entertainment .
it felt to me that the author needs to put in more drama this was too simplistic and predictable .
it could have more pockets and be a little bit larger . and i like the way the chain is made .
my son chose this app since he loves the original game . he was not very impressed with this app however .
this movie could have been better . it was okay and i did get to see some action in this movie .
not up there with her best .
is a great movie for the to early teen age range . high school musical extended edition
i liked the back story with the gods and all , but could do with a better explanation of their world .
not sure what i am doing wrong . got this adapter and asus ac router , but no ac signal at adapter .
i liked is soft and pretty but made a little big for my taste wished it was a little smaller
for my pain this did no better than bio freeze or ben gay . not worth the extra time and expense .
it was ok , the movie was better .
pretty fun wish it would move a little faster between games but i enjoy playing it , helps me to relax
nice way to waste time . can play for minutes or hours . nice bright colors easy to play . good fun game
cool lighting , lasted about months in a sheltered outdoor area
only seemed moderately effective at reducing eliminating pain and swelling around my left knee cap joint . probably would not ever re order .
it is not disney authentic but kids can play anna with it .
i like it but it's too small . igot the largest size they had !
an okay book but too hard to make most of the changes required
i read this on an international flight it didn't help me sleep !
if you operational system is windows vista do not buy this book because you will not hear the spoken pronunciation .
exactly like the original oem cable . these cables are specific to the model , are quite fragile , and are not cheap .
solid , tight , rocking , well recorded by fine players but really its all been done before .
entertaining as it was , it was all a bit too neatly wrapped and some of the dialogue was unnatural . overall . worthwhile .
it was cool at first but it shorted out within months
it's okay for the price , but folding the cover in order to make it a stand doesn't always work well .
this did not feel like a die hard movies to mejust isn't up to the caliber of the series
its working as expected .
great for kids to learn something from prehistoric times . my kids really enjoyed this movie as a family . thumbs up !
good job except for the pictures
interesting in a historical sense , but somewhat repetitious . a bit drawn out . it could have had more action or drama .
considering the added weight there wasn't that much additional flying time but definitely a good addition to the flight box
it's just ok for a sudoku game ! it works , gets the job done ! so give it a whirl and see !
it is not minecrsct but at lise is something else . it is not minecract but at lise is something else .
front windows vents fits perfect but the back window vents were to large for the windows .
too many adjetives ! simple story but drawn out . a decent beachh book but too predictable . far from an original idea .
the sock itself is pretty good . the ice packs a bit difficult to insert .
regular gift card . no problem getting it , or activating it . i got it through email within minutes of buying it .
i like the bell , i really needed one but not sure the sticker i love my bike will last
broke right away
works but i had no need for it .
good read for older gun owners . good overall compared to newer versions .
i really enjoy doing the logo games but find myself using a lot of hints because they are quite hard .
not quite as comfortable as some i've tried on at stores locally . a little more snug than i would've liked .
the shorts are shorter than they appear in the picture , i would recommend buying a size up .
really poor quality its that the job ok for now any way i can get a new one soon ! lol
could not watch it , buffering every seconds . switched to netflix and had no problems . the same problem all day .
best relation with chuan tzu , to be deeped and read more .

the hooks are too narrow to sit correctly on the grab bars in my murano so the rod pops off .
the med was too small and the large was too big . did not work for me .
it's ok but i found out i can buy a gallon of rv pool antifreeze at any walmart for . oops .
since when does a nubile young woman with her thoughts and past performs in such a manner as this book ?
these sandals are very pretty but there isn't much room in the toe area , pinches your feet .
i found this item to be too big and take up too much counter space so ended up returning it .
i try to read as much king as i can this is right in line can't get enough thank you
lots of music . very good . added to collection
there are some beautiful pictures in this book , but not enough of a story to keep my little guy interested .
on battery at least , its way underpowered . great if youre less than feet away otherwise its not much use . n .
interesting book on the fall of abn . it was a bit long winded and written in a very dutch manner .
it's blacked out , the character's i mean . otherwise it's pretty good with the story . i just can't play without the picture .
they look just like the picture , but they slide down a lot and they're kind of see through .
nice quality for price was expecting tote to be used for daily use more the size of an overnight bag
it's great . thanks for making me write this stupid review before being able to read my assignments . i enjoyed it .
items to find are very hard to distinguish from background . instructions not very clear , at least , are hard to find . jolie
easy to follow recipes if you have all the ingredients and don't have to go to the store , tasty recipes
this story is pleasant , interesting , a bit predictable , enjoyable . i would have liked for it to move a little faster .
i was expecting something different but it was good movie i do recommend this movie many can relate to this
the doll was a gift for my great niece . she seemed to love it .
this rice is healthy and pretty good tasting . a deal for the money . uses a lot of water to cook
nice gloves , but i tend to get really cold hands and i think a liner would be good with these .
these dresses are running really small . the xx large is still running really small for xx large dress
todavia estoy esperando el producto , realice dos pedidos que nunca me llegaron y no se donde reclamarlos , obviamente estan pagos .
this is a good book , but other books by reid are more informative .
it was o . k . , but not wonderful . i am anxious , however to see the movie . perhaps i will like it better .

cute as a conversation starter with your kid . communication with children and adults is key to a healthy relationship . thanks
i bought these for my son ! they were very long and they look a bit girlie ! however they are durable !
display resolution could be better and there is no led light to function as flash for photo's when needed . it's working .
just stars
i am still learning to handle it , but it seems a little flimsy for the money spent !
i cannot really tell any difference and it is exspensive . i really like the strivectin tl tightening face serum much better .
it was ok i am not reccomending it to friends . i love the author but the acting was only fair
you get what you pay for . some worked better than others and even the best ones didn't work that great .
it was short and sweet ! i didn't see the end coming in this one it was unbelievable to me , really .
like the art . ok for fun .
for my wife and while used at first not any more . change in taste ?
just louder than the speaker of cellphone . if you want to enjoy the music , choose the bose or better one .
kids like it . i'm from the south , so its not my style .
my hair is stick straight and though the iron curls it doesn't stay ! decent for the price for sure ! hot
it was an ok movie , worth watching at least one timegreat concept , good acting , but not the greatest special affect .
bourn legacylots of action , very little plot story line , predictable . good photography . movie much better without matt damon . wouldn't recommend .
it is an amusing concept but didn't really hold my interest to play it more than a time or two .
they are not bad for the price . comfortable , cheap . can't ask for more . but you get what you pay for
it doesn't put out enough water to suit me might do better on a larger hose , ok for washing cars .
its ok its a little confusing at first . but you get used to it and figure out how it works .
it looks okay but the quality not so good zippers on the sides are sharp it would scratch your hands .
was ok , funny seemed historically accurate but just didn't have enough pazzaz . seemed like some over acting on the drunk scenes .
nice and warm but i don't like the material and expensive . the packing was not good enough . i do not recomand .
its either not shocking enough for my dog to stop barking or it simply doesnt work for both my dogs
not bad , but i inadvertently ordered this brand instead of sweetleaf orange flavor . sweetleaf is just a little more flavorful .
heavy on the atmosphere . genre rich . haunting vocals . not accessible to all listeners , but worth exploring just for the experience .
came with dead battery . took a bit to figure out how to get music loaded . after that it worked fine .
although mellowing out considerably on its second side , quartet remains one of hancock's stronger traditional post bop offerings .
very fast . sporadic and large . this is not a small toy .
decent show acting is just ok ? and premise seems a little strange could go in any direction ! !
the material , shape and price are good but the hem could have been done better . it cheapens the entire look .
this book is okay but he's continuously leaving stuff out and trying to get you to by his other books .
they are a little on the dry side , both the pretzel and the caramel . although , the chocolate is pretty good .
the butterfly on his head was broken

they are wonderful !
only problem was that one of the bulbs was dead !
mu fingers don't work very well . i couldn't get it straight on my phone . i sure that it works fine .
pretty slow and i didn't think all that funny . i was looking for stand up comedy not a round table forum
cute , but it started coming off about months after i put it on but only the tail bit though
it was a good story , felt that james and lydia were easy to picture , could predict the twist early on .
typical well written short history story unlike most modern rubbish . apart from agatha raising , hamish mcbeth type of mystery tales .
i was expecting a movie but it turned out to be a one person narrative . i much preferred blackkhawk down .
certainly a different twist ! funny
the dress was beautiful , but i found that it was not true to size and unfortunately had to return it .
great as a clit stimulator , but as g spot stimulation , it sucks . way to soft and do not hit the spot .
i have wanted this blanket for my friend for a long time i was very pleased y'all had one left
this tool arrived extremely dull . it would have been great if sharpened , but i have no way of doing that .
cute
since i gave it as a wedding gift i have no way to rate it .
did not know it was recycled , would not have purchased . would like hp xl new . i will not order again .
supensful
the song you are thinking of is right now by sr . its not on the soundtrack !
in spite of some useful information just not enough to use for growth or change . approach not helpful to me
wasn't expecting something quite so flimsy for . but it's serving it's intended purpose . color is very pretty though .
i like the books . but really the dialogue and pacing were dull . that's all i have to say . word word
i lost the bow in weeks . i ahte the fact that the bow is so easy to take off
a year old forrest gump reflects on his outrageous past , all while out running the law . an ok story .
does what is says . good for bringing air into a small room . cord is heavy duty and it is pretty quiet .
nice
i really like this book thank you for making such a good book can t wait to read the next book
kind of small for me im tall and have bigger hands this is so teeny weeny lol
i like it but its too thin as a ring . if it has a thicker body it would be really great .
i thought this movie did a great job showing the value of sisterhood and your nearest and dearest friends .
nice play tog but could not figure out how to put treat in .
the game can be played without the kit . it's a great game , but the kit tends to be cumbersome .
gracias por su env iacute o , como siempre . a uacute n no leo el libro , peroespero que resulte interesante .
product is generally well made , but disappointing that the cover is too big for the tube itself . very loose fitting .
i really do not like the new movies they are making for star trek . took busy and too noisy for me .
meh if you wanting something nice get something different this works fine though . i wouldn't count on it .
there was a printing error in the middle months , they were covered with blue ink . other than that , it's fine .
great price for screen covers , however they didn't fit my genric tablet

it was just ok ! the strap it really cheap looking so i removed it . it's cute but a little small .
kinda small on the kindle fire . inchstill i like it ! good fin in the dr's waiting room , worth the try

the chair is nice for the money , but the distance between the seat and kneeler can't be changed .
nice book . kind of boring . need it for class ! it was not that intersting . the online movie is much better
quality of material was subpar . after one use stiching started to come undone . it seemed smaller than i expected . disappointed .
the mirror is tiny . i know the demensions were given but i didn't realize that the mirror was this small .
want this review deleted . why doesn't amazon have a delete button ? good question . so they get something like this . irritating .
sometimes these work , other times the printer doesn't like them . i will look for another brand that is more consistent .
the watch is all silver and does not have any rose tone like the picture looks like
they come unscrewed easily and head to put back together . but i like the colors when i write worn them
not for me . none of my friends play . doesn't keep me entertained . i wouldn't recommend it to anyone to play
the fabric is soft and pretty , comfortable to wear but the only thing is the color is alittle too bright
book is rather elementary but has useful information for one desiring to better understand high voltage measurement techniques .
wish she stayed with nightwish , where she was great . now shes going down hill . fast
worth seeing for bruce dern's acting . think i'll watch it again to see if i've missedwhatever made it oscar worthy .
when you sweat its easily fogs the goggles . i love the fit and the look though . great price point also
this shirt looks cheap and worn already out of the package . it is also much shorter than today's fashion shirts .
its a nice album i think its a little bazaar but they call it horror core its coo alitte different
win average ok , easy to see , colorful , good to use while waiting in line in our busy lives . stress relief
this book is awesome ! i rate this book because it's delicious ! thank you ! i hope you'll write more books
its an okay product that fits well . doesn't prevent damage from a fall though and th green gets dirty fast .
for cd's and a workbook , it is overpriced . it is of good quality though .
doodle jump is a little old know all you do is jump around and dodge monsters and fall that's it .
it's a good read but just not my reading level . i can definitely understand why a teen would like it .
not totally happy . the paper cover of this hard cover book was torn , due to poor packaging
i love ghadda samman but this book irritated me so much . started on the wrong side messy has a lot of spelling errors
well written with a few twists and turns . plot was deep enough to keep my interest .
like others i thought i might learn something new from this book . but , it is filled with only basic information .
i really liked them . it was the perfect gift . my only problem is that they do seem a little breakable .
doesnt work all that good . the right stick doesn't work right .
i'm a action movie fan . premis good , but holes in plot . action sequences i truly enjoyed . no sequel needed . thanks
a solid album , including perhaps their most famous single , quot signs quot . but if you want their best , buy their self titled album .
the light flickers on and off . otherwise , stylish and good . it should have a lager storage capacity for lesser refills .
nice pillow and the quality is fine but the color was more turquoise than the blue i was hoping for .
first bottle . will let you know on next review if we purchase another bottle .
it's good for the price . it's work well for a new look for your phone and it propects it well .
i guess i got what i paid for . they were thin but i used them all with no major calamities .
i love the case . i got it in black . pro'sfits perfectlycon'sslap band is a little too tighti love it though !
i took a bit of a struggle to finish this book . am not sure why . it just didn't grab me .
wish i could give this a thumbs up , but several of the compartments open spontaneously , dropping contents all over purse
i thought it would be fluffy and soft but it is flat and rough . i'm very dissappointed with this purchase .
it was ok kind of cheesyi would reread it if i could . nice writing and i liked the characters
it worked ok for a few months then the wire just broke off at where you plug to the laptop .
great additional stories , finally we know how arriane got her scar and have a look on mile and shelby's trip .
it takes longer time to melt the crayon than the timer says but the kids still have fun with it
despite indicating that this unlocked , not this and had to pay nine dollars extra to buy a unlock code .
falls off in the wind . if you secure it very tight , and tuck it under the tires , it will stay on .
i have seen tom cruise in much better movies . the story line logically did not make sense . somewhat action packed .
this is a movies to watch if nothing else is on . it is not a bad movie nor great movie .
it looked like it would be a perfect fit for my new asus , but it isn't so i am disappointed .
a little stiff as a pocketbook . very fashionable with a little bling on it . not what i expected though . thanks
digital copy is ultra violet . wish it was a regular digital copy that would download to ipad , iphone , or ipod .
in short , nice little stories but lacked the poignancy of the bard .
they look really nice in the car and make it look very sexy ! they'll help protect the floor from damage !
its a fun starter toy for your young explorers . i would order another for other little explorers in my family .
my son really loved this gift . he couldn't wait to get it out and play with it . enjoyed this one .
i was expecting more figure bottoms on it . out of just like are figures . some not that nice .
the gold part on mine wasn't even by the edge of the gauge , it was like more towards the middle .
you pay a good bit for this compared to similar products . you can probably do better at the big chains .
cute earmuffs . cubs' bullseye logo is only on one muff . perfect for vincent van gogh and other solo earred people .
you know it works with windows but not with windows kind of frustrating to not have something work
i like the turner part , however , the diameter of the handle is to small so it isn't easy to hold .
i loved the watch but was not happy when the battery died w i months !
would have liked more bass but its ok for the price . easy set up and looks nice with our tv .
gave it to my niece years old she wasn't too crazy about it . more geared toward a younger child .
it was not one that i would recommend due to the language and the sexual nature . a rather shallow book
it's a fun game but it's not as fun as playing with real people and it can be very challenging
haven't used it that much to rate it . only had it for a month or so , will rate later ok
its an okay knife
it is a nice set but it's not worth the price . wal mart sells it for less the half the price .
just ok
gets hot and always smells of burning dust . does the job well enough .
good book ! kept you intrigued throughout ! could've done without the f word in there . overall i would recommend it to friends .
seems to have a very orange tinge to it .
for price can't beat it . good for first dress watch for young . leather band gives it away as cheap .
my set was missing one ring for my standard size shower curtain . super weird . other than that , they were fine .
i'd recommend the del close book if you want a good read on improv . this is for kids
the drawers were not sliding smoothly . very frustrating . i had to readjust on of the slider but it still didnt work .
considering the price , it is not bad . it came from china . elastic waist is a bit small . it is fine .
i thought these would have plastic backing to prevent drool from absorbing into clothes . not the case .
not baf but dont pay for it not worth it . you can get the same thng free if you feally look
i would have liked it more had i been a woman .
if your stomach is not flat or nearly flat , this absolutely gorgeous to look at dress is not for you !
not true to size runs very large . order smaller than usual or keep looking . ok for short term use .
the book came on time . thank you
i ready did a review . i like it that was it
repetitious wordiness and a slow moving story line detract from the interesting detail of the tumultuous events covered by this novel .
it didn't really keep the heat very well
these are very crunchy and small pressure it brake them like glass , recommend using safety glasses during work with .
bad set of pixels in center of screen
this book is fine if you want an abridged version with commentary providing historical background . it is aimed at students .
for those of you that want to delve a little more deeply than watching weekly psychic shows read and enjoy .
i can only download song , then it crashes ! but i can always remove from device then reinstall . its ok .
not that it matered that much to me , but the screwdriver that accompanied the battery was useless . battery works fine . domenico .
i like it comfortable but not for really cold weather . comfortable but not for really cold weather .
a lot of the information is outdated or wrong . these are just basic facts about them . try their kissing techniques !
nasty taste , couldn't drink it
why can't i just rate a product with stars ? what does amazon torture me so ? woah is me forever tormented .
love that its light and airy . it does fit a little large . received item within the time expected . thank you
not a best seller but enough to keep your interest . definitely needs better editing . why all bad spelling ? dejacobs live . comeleanor jacobs
it's okay nothing amazing .
it wasn't exactly what i wanted , but i kept it .
slightly predictable and very wordy , and very long . still enjoyable to read what is happening in lynley's and barbara's lives .
romantic and wonderful , sultry hot latin lovers music .
even though it was new in the package the battery life still only last no more than day and half
if you are writing a book on now to read and understand chinese , you don't write the book in chinese ,
it's a good buy bought it for my husband and it's exactly what we were looking for . we recommend it .
i really liked the hat . it was made nicely . it looks so adorable on my eight month old baby girl .
the gloves fit well and were the perfect length for our theatrical production . they were much darker than i expected .
it's ok for what you pay for it , its cheap and kind of flimsy to . but to each it's on .
gloves are ok finger liner has already separated and the gloves will turn your hands blue if your hands sweat .
i bought this to hold our living room remotes . it works for this purpose but not as nice as pictured .
if you don't expect anything more than shooting and babes barely dressd , you'll enjoy this one .
not one of the best books i've read , but certainly not the worst . book moved too slow for my taste
it was not full screen and you couldn't get it to full screen . made game hard to see hidden objects .
it's ok for the price given , it works well with my nexus tablet , i can not complait about it
the bass drum was ripped . couldn't return and get new one by christmas . doubt my kid noticed but we did !
the recipes seem interesting but there are only ? otherwise may try some of them . red velvet pancake sounded yummy !
her honor's bodyguard has good storyline but the spelling and grammatical errors made this book extremely hard to get through .
although the ink cartridges perform as advertised i feel they don't last long enough for the high price .
some of the glosses are quite small . i was hoping there were more glosses to go along with the sentences .
crap crap crappy crap crapc qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm jdjsjejsjsnbdhfbd d . as . did d s s s . w dr . black do iiiinotchby
didnt do what i thought , but maybe im not doing it right , i dont know ! dont know if ill buy again , fast shipping though
after a few days laying on the deck , and a few rain showers , paint started coming off the black pentagons .
straps don't stay up otherwise soft and spongy and comfortable !
good story line , but excessive technical information .
cute sandal with slightly large foot bed about size up . i ordered a but it fit like a .
the book was well written . it kept my interest , but somewhat depressing . not a great book to read on vacation .
i believe the game should me more set up like donkey kong of super nintendo than confusing players !
it was an okay read . probably wouldn't read it again . a bit too cheesy for me . everything happened too easily .
you need to aim the remote directly towards it .
disappointed . did not cool like i wanted it to .
i liked this , but way too short . this is well written , makes one feel as if it were happening . nice .
it is fine but it is cheap quality but then again it didn't cost much so i am satisfied .
cd sound not so good . love the big letters . great for an alarm clock
i love warm , spiced cider , but this is a little too sweet for my tastes . my kids like it , though .
it was entertaining , but left me hanging . not one of my top picks . wife did nit like this one . next
good but not what i had expected . also own a ps which blows xbox one away in almost every category .
it was a cute little story .
hard plastic , cracked the st week , but still stays on and works . i suppose it protected the phone still !
i will let you know about it after i finish watching it . thanks ! god bless you ! have a great daygeorges
was still tight and husband is usually a x
easy to operate but did not find many stations that either i listened to or played genre playlist that i enjoyed .
this app is okay to use to look at feed and follow people but your not able to download pictures
not impressed with the quality of this case and i would question if it is even a lifeproof case . buyer beware !
this book was okay , but i've read far better ones . books like twilight are what i call really good books .
worked fine when got , now experiencing freeze up and slow downloads . seems like some programs are overpriced .
this was a gift and it fit ok don't know if it going to be used all the time thanks
it does the job and that about it . don't expect this to be a littman , because it ain't . nuff said .
that you have to wait minutes for this to soak in and then you have to wash it off .
great for the price when you need it most or when elec . is not availble you need to buy this
replaced a worn out screw that would not retract from corks after bottle was opened . this replacement works as advertised .
i thought this was a pretty movie , have liked all the texas chainsaw movies , i hope they make another one !
this book had some good tongue twisters . some i can't even say because they twisted my tongue !
a good product . it's okay . as i expected . does exactly what it should do a battery keep the notebook connected .
i love the playstation but not for dollars sorry . stop stealing my playstations ! you silly silly people who resell
it suites the case . not much to right home about .
the inside isn't as big as you think . plus it's pretty heavy . seems solid so i think it's a good buy
interesting but not laugh out louis i was hoping . a light read but not hilarious as i had hoped . ok
okay to pass the time but hard to figure out how some of the words go together on my kindle .
i didn't even receive the fan back style of these cards . but that's fine , i guess .
i have not gotten my dress ! and it was supose to come on the sixteenth of september ! i need it
but she managed to destroy it over time . it did last longer than majority doggy toys that we have brought .
it's cute at first , but then the studs come off pretty easily . the case honestly lasts for about months .
the flax granola is better . this is kind of mixed in flavor . didn't like it so much
alittle smaller than expected but it is fine for the price . like the colors too it will work out fine
this case did not come with a hand strap very disappointing was thinking about sending it back but kept it
the title is very much misleading . although a decent read , you are left dissatisfied .
need more free points per day they run out quickly . more free points might entice me to purchase more points .
the first few chapters were hard to get into but got better as i read .
it's not too bad if you like women portrayed as bimbos with doofas boy friends and hapless gangsters .
camera fits really tight , sz . no room for additional battery pack . but , is a nice case . four more words required ?
i was somewhat disappointed in this book as it did not deliver what was promised in reviews of this book .
does not give enough information .
attaches nicely to the vent . does not hold my iphone very well with the audio jack in the bottom .
keep rocking with this one . add it to a already large collection . bring back the old days of stoning around .
very good workout , but it can not work longer than min on highest resistance comming to no resistance at all .
this game is fun , but it is hard . you must buy hints , but overall this is a fun family game !
the rice balls were okay , a little hard and i was required me to break them up for my dogs .
did not come back this year
these are nice enough but tiny is an understatement . these would be great for a child , not sure about an adult .
very light and predictableas mentioned plot is thin and very predictable as you get into the stories episodes
rendezvous was a decent and easy military action read . i like nelson demille and this was average for his work .
too little about a war dog . not interested in this particular kind of story , although , the story , itself , is good .
only one of the knobs works on the heater controls . i have no clue what the other ones go to .
only thing good abou this documentary was the voice of rod serling . other than that i found the film dated .
gift .
the silver around the broken glass which gives a sparkle effect is chipping . i should have done without this piece .
the unit is ok but it dontstay charged long enough so i keep it on charge . love the new sound
it's ok , it works
very difficult to put on walker
bought this as a b day present for dh . it was less expensive than at cosco . appears to work well .
no sound its works opens and all but no beep it says beep but it don't it don't beep bye
this jacket is constantly loosing feathers , may need to return it some places there are no feathers left . super disappointed
when making toast , turning the knob is sometime difficult for an older person . wish i would have purchased a different model .
book was dated dated not exactly what i expected thank you very muchhappy holidays
i have to rate or quit . so far i like the game but have to play more to find out
flaws no eject button and no led light other then that awsome
nice to have a happy ending .
good game easy to pass but i cant run worth crap nd it crashes on me sometimes on kindle fire
good knife but the screw always gets loose after a while . so keep that in mind when you buy this .
get sizes bigger
i'm not sure how long it will last , but it serves it's purpose , and it took forever to get here
faded fast worn fast good price for a cheep product i recomend this for delicate uses not in direct sunlight
works most of the time .
wasn't the funny that i was expecting . my husband and i were disappointed . now white chicks was a funny movie .
they were ok . i wear them all day . like the color . somewhat comfy , wash well . i won't be buying more .
i enjoyed it , even though it seemed mindless . helped me relax . recommended for children and easy go ers . not novelists especially .
not very impressive and would not fit properly and stay adhered to the tooth . would not recommend because of flaws .
i don't think that these beads are real turquoise , but the necklace is pretty . it is a bit disappointing however .
just found the content tracks to be disappointing . i probably should have been more careful in reading the product description .
it did not fit with the case on , bummer . you should double check case compatibility before you buy this product .
left side dead on arrival . replacement satisfactory . main drawbacks are the narrow viewing angle and the reflectivity of the screen .
the book is better tom cruise just okay as jack . i am glad i didn't pay movie prices for it .
wish the actor actor had turned out to be her father . and stunt double his nephews dad . possible sequel . dibs !
predictable story with very clumsy dialogue and characters . really nothing special although not terrible . i won't be reading this again
patterson's books are always a good read . his short chapters keep the story line moving without losing the readers interest .
this shirt fits pretty darn tightly . i wear it as an undershirt , it's too sheer for me to wear alone
it held my interest but the story line was too predictable . so surprises
it was good a great dvd with to legends of mma great thing to own if like chuck or tito
evidently my taste buds do not go along with montova's . i really thought that it would have more garlic flavor .
this ring was much , much thinner than i thought it was going to be and runs small . it's just okay .
the kurti was small and i wish it would have been of better quality . one wash and it will shrink .
just needed for kit
it's not all that i thought it would be , butit works great and was really cheap !
i play every now and then . my husband loves checkers fee plays for hours
limited on putting on but works you have to make sure wheel in in right position to place lock on
if you enjoy politics and philosophical exploration of the issues of the day you will swallow this novel whole .
the product seems to work well , the only negative is the feel and the slightly higher than nuetral odor .
decent shoes for chillin
it is good but i am talking it in short spots . it depends on the individual ability for complex thoughts .
works just okay . there is a low level hum introduced by it .
durable , perfect and not too bulky . i have small wrists and most watches dont fit well but this one does .
good game . typical glu business model , tho . get in cheap , get hosed later with in game purchasing . pretty fun and challenging .
the was not a good story agood story because i knew the ehding too soon and it was too slow
bleak , but satisfying , i enjoyed this skewed family story , though the cover seems completely unrelated , and that always bugs me !
the snowflake floating candles were okay , they burned for about hours . very difficult to relight if they got wet .
if i had to see the term girly parts one more time . really , get a thesaurus ! ok story , disjointed , predictable .
a few hits , random album tracks stick with 's ultimate manilow instead .
classic movie from my childhood . mel brooks at his best
not the promise that i expected
i like the outfit . it's cute . but it was a lurge tends to be really snugged .
it was an alright book , but i read it all the way through but i couldn't really get into it .
they did not stick very well so had to be ironed and glued also .
very nice for decoration in my kitchen . however , the dispenser feels a little delicate to actually put in to use .
nice short story . really liked it . free book worth the read . easy reading for anyone . very good story for anyone
it was cute . funny and a good read . kids love it and it was worth getting i do reccomend it .
generic
much smaller that you would think in person . if it was larger it would be perfect .
it came broken but i fixed it ! it's super cute
the cd is okay . she has a beautiful voice but i wish they had chosen better music to showcase it .
fine not good not bad . right in the middle of most of the keuring shaped coffee i have tried .
it was onteresting and informative . good research was done for this book . author went through many things to make this real .
they need to make a better onehdhdhdhdhdhdhdx hands d d d d d d d d d d d
the sheet is great . unfortunately i found it priced at half of what i paid at a pyrex outlet store .
i placed the order of the size months , months received , the disguise is useless for this reason .
it's ok for when there is nothing better to watch . acting is ok for what the actors had to show .
the bolts and nuts is not included . that is special part . this item is no good for me .
smell great and while not as effective as traditional repellants , helped repel mosquitos .
same as the black don't last
basically good starter set . spills quite easily while pouring . i expected something more dazzling but it's good for entertaining guests .
ok more of a comic book style , not cartoon
this is a good chick lit , even though the outcome is fairly predictable . will definitely read more of nana malone .
nice continuance to mr . penumbra's hour bookstore , but not as well written .
i liked girls first season . second season was ok . seemed to get a bit predictable and some episodes were annoying .
short was too big
it is a quality original product . best option for the bb bold . love the ease of use and quality .
the message was interesting but revealing it boring , ah , men can't live with them and thinking can live without them .
product looks better in the picture than in person . this table runner also looks cheap , but it isn't too bad .
bought on super clearance . tasted a little stale , so i guess i got what i paid for . okay .
gets the job done and very well priced . nothing special , but it will work for us . would prefer something more substantial .
this was an ok book star , nothing to get as excited about as the other reviewers did .
not quite as inclusive and artistic as i had expected . perhaps it reflects the pines differently than i remember them .
they still let some spray through and even though it didn't stain the appearance until she showered was not appealing .
has everything i need but tools are a little flimsy . some may not last through the season .
i thought this would a little larger in size , but they work alright for accents in a toy story bathroom .
decent but they start to smell really bad in work boots . good cushion and arch support , but could be better .
really enjoyed this . would recommend it to all who want to continue the epic tragedy of the halocaust . very well written !
i really liked this game because i am a huge movie buff but if your not then don't buy it .
what can i say , it does the job and is ok . it covers and protects the kindle fire from damage
hard to actully color for both my kids and me when showing them how to use it . it's just okay
fun shooter game . the addition of moral choices was a good twist . great graphics and i hate the big boss !
was a little disappointed that it linked a couple of times .
an good read , but not as fast moving as bitten and stolen .
i like . i just don't like when you kill her . she looks like she has a penis . i like her big boobs .
this didn't last very long . it fell apart within months .
does what it is intended to do without issue , well made and it seems it will last . color selection works .
ok .
two of them came broken , but didn't expect much . cute though .
it was ok for awhile then all the stones started falling off . i was disappointed in this product and quality
works okay , short focal length , hard to get through degree elbows in . inch pipe .
i deleted another solitaire app because it had single ads . this app has the same ads . that is very disappointing .
thank u it was good i had trouble at first ordering but at the end turned out great .
a bit slow , but typical . i always enjoy louis's books . easy reading . very descriptive of the desert and it's many issues .
verbose
it was interesting but i think his other books were better
the laser would not adjust far enough to get on target when mounted on my lower quadrail of an ar
this case is fine , looks close to the picture . it can be a little wider to cover more of the front .
its ok
short but sweet . a cute , quick read . would recommend for those of us who love the victorian era . i sure do .
this looks fun . i got it for my year old nephew . and he loves it . he loves watching this car race .
these aren't as good as the old design , although they look cooler . the wine leaks out if the bottle tips .
it was ok .
causes a slow charging rate , when compared to the cable provided by the manufacturer . everything else is working as expected .
easy read . little ridiculous but funny . typical kinsella humor . it dragged out longer than it needed and a predictable ending .
this game was ok kept my attention played for hours fun to play nice colors i really enyoted this game
works ok for most of the usbs i have used , i try with some micro sd cards and works fine
pretty good
use it to jump a . l suburban . no issues . have owned over a year . prosworks as expectedconswhy so expensive ?
its a solid sturdy product , but its a tool box , not a trunk organizer , its quiet small , doesn't hold much .
i keep breaking these for some reason . not sure if it's cheap plastic or what .
it was easy to use somewhat challenging to figure out from instructions . but the equipment seemed to be decent enough
this came better than what i was expecting . and really good for what i need it .
this book was a little predictable and repetitive . girl was weak at times which i find annoying . an ok read .
was disappointed that the fit was not appropriate for a month old child . it was very d isproportionately short .
tibetan groovei really like the music , however i was waiting for more groove . another product misnamed !
very light , cheap metal that isn't terribly sturdy so i'm disappointed . it looks heavier and better quality in the picture .
it do turn on and off , however , the battery cover is very loss , it is very noizy when it operate .
i'd say about half the things i reference are in here still worth the purchase .
it's a spray bottle what are you expecting ? for the price it does what it's required to do nothing else .
the single tea cup rack was just as described . displays cup saucer to perfect advantage . glad i found it !
enough said . i have to lace down the entire boot just to put it on . but they are really cute .
i liked this story because it is part of the army beast series , but there was something missing , not enough about sable .
this filter works but doesnt last long it fills up w dust and dirt and cloggs the vaccum too pricy
not what i expected , but my daughter likes it . it' fun , but could be better !
i expected more from this item but not . it is look like cheap ring from open market . no real silver
i have a kindle fire and my son plays this game . but while he was flying his jet , it froze .
not the typical book i'd read , but it kept me interested and i liked it ! character s were very believable .
i purchased the original over a decade ago . wore it out ! this new purchase was a replacement for the original .
it looks good but i haven't even tried it yet i'm afraid to admit . i will try it soon .
it served my purpose . i'm going through a difficult time in my life and need to make some changes . good .
i think this is one the good jean claud movies but not good as previous movies .
this green tea is a little strong so i sweeten it with some honey . it's good tea though .
i started watching this and i'm not sure if it was too slow or i was too tired . i fell asleep .
does the job . wish they fit a little better . she always looks like she has droopy drawers .
its pretty and bold , the materials are nice , but its falling apart and have only used it for days
their version of a large is smaller than american sizes . looks cute on my friend though who luckily fit it !
i find this product handy and very useful . pitty that the battery dies very fast .
good piece kinda cheap though
looks great , but iphone doesn't respond quickly when touched with the ampen , which isn't good if you're playing a game
size is smaller than real size . shipped from asia . slow shipping .
how much can you really say about this item . as long as it works there is not much to say .
this book had some recipe that i like but i haven't try ut anyrecipes yet . it's good book overall .
i'm much interested to know francis better . the book cover good and not so good aspects of his fascinating personality .
i didn't realize it was a short film . i actually wanted more for how strange the story actually is .
to much like graphic novel . not enough development and too superficial . i would not recommend this to anyone over fifteen
overall , i like the case a lot . the only complaint i have is that the power standby button is very touchy .
this product works well on fairly new thinset , but wouldn't touch year old stuff .
male sm story . graphic descrption of torture and sex , some emotion . not bad
my granddaughter really liked it and we all loved the rainbow zippers . quality was very nice and size was also
seems like a good series and the characters are interesting .
its good overall , but the melon baller is rotating in the handle after a couple of uses .
works great , it holds without making your hair get hard . it stays put , even after a long day of work
its too soon to rate . will have to use it more . when used more i will be able to rate
i ordered the pet carpet fresh and was sent apple cinnimon carpet fresh . wish i had gotten what i ordered .
good neutral color , smaller than i envisioned . useful . nothing fancy . blends well with patio decor . good to use with matching planter .
mailed it back got a small and it fits fine i usually wear a medium . nice braided straps
very decent j lo with fat joe , and big pun not a bad joint but still i've heard better .
it's a narrower and thinner band than i thought it would be . still not bad for the price i paid .
who swallowed harold is a good book . i liked all the great and funny poems . it's a good book . really .
it's a very good product , i recommend for internet connections on pc's . it works very good and it receives
it keeps saying there is a update available but every time i try to update the game . nothing . nada ! feeling frustrated .
good little beach read . thought i knew who the perp was , so i was a little surprised at the ending .
we like this product mostly , but sometimes it feels really hot and burns when we use it .
this is a very cute tshirt but order a few sizes up or it will be difficult to get on .
looks durable and easy to use . but does not fold down as compact for storing in a small car trunk .
pretty plain but serves it purpose . you can see through the screen very clearly . was shipped in good shape though .
the manual is good to have , but lacks the level of detail that i would like .
the book only has a couple of songs that i enjoy playing and they are not challenging enough for me .
i ts an alright game nothing overly exhuberant to report . sometimes you het stuck on a level but then you prevail
this book does not have rationals for correct answers . other then that , it might be helpful is reviewing chapter material .
tastes good , a little pricey , not much for your money . i would recommend something with verified ingredients like cytosport products .
i enjoyed the depiction of cognitive decline and the mysteryi found the use of italics distractingoverall an enjoyable read
this book was recommended to me . i've only had timeto peruse it . seems effective at a glance . gives options
there is no personality in any of people . the plot didn't get any build up , it was just thrown in .
this product is more for show than for use . it is too small for the kids strangely large toothbrushes .
its ok ! nothing short of ok all music is starting to sound the same different beat same ole messages .
for the price this is nice . i wear it on my tops . the back fell off to soon . had to glue back on .
i haven't used these yet but based on the other reviews read here it will be a great purchase decision
not as good as part one . not sure if i will read part three . but i did love part one .
i received this in proper time , but it was to small . i returned the dress and recieved a promt credit .
smaller than i anticipated although served the purpose in our christmas play . looked appropriate in an yr old hand .
a silly comedy . but i wasn't expecting anything serious or deep thought . great to see a lot of different comedians .
chips easily . even with a top coat . easy to apply . extremely white .
functioned fine once we purchased the batteries for it . i think it would have better if the batteries were included .
i didn't think marshals investigated crime . guess they are replacing the cops . oh well fiction is fiction . like the service .
it rolls up and it bulges .
this is way too much magnification for us . otherwise is is a very nice looking item and works as advertised .
story was slow . not enough usual gadgets , cars . a lot different from the usual bond flicks . enjoyed watching daniel craig
the case didn't really fit my . inch tablet . but the keyboard works great ! i encourage all to buy it .
the sock fits a little tight . really tight around the top . very hot and burns my feet . not the greatest
a simple romance , easy to read but not very challenging . will interest some readers who just want an uncomplicated simple read .
laser attached to pistol would not fit . had to remove stitches to make it work correctly . still does not wok smoothly .
nice quick healthy love story . knew the girl would get the boy at the end . easy reading for all ages .
small stones to work with but nice little pocket size set . coloring is nice , not too pale for rose quartz .
a bit tedious and not much fun . save your , get a better game .
certainly not the best , but engaging , thoughtful and i will read the second in the series . worth a read folks .
did just an okay job at concealing light brown spots red marks . very difficult to get out of tube .
the book gave me information i have read before . the book was a fairly fast read . the information is helpful .
good in winter balls run out of bounce after or games
it work everywere
not the best movie for either of these wonderful actors . the bishop's wife was headsand tales above this one .
i am usually pleased with veratex products but this one looks as inexpensive as it was functional , not too harsh fabric .
somewhat warm . waterproof still need to see it . my gloves stayed wet . for a week after rain .
i was a bit disappointed to be honest . maybe older people would enjoy it , it's not my cup of tea . thank you anyway . rosie . g
i only received a very short version of this book hence the star review . i enjoyed what i received .
happy with the product but you get what you pay for batteries do not charge up to but work
visegrips and inserts work well . however , the snaps are not usable outdoors . the tools are worth the price though .
great book to understand there is help for teens with a healthy diet , vitamins and most of all natural hormones .
it was not as good as the first . i also had to pay for it . hoping for a better third .
will not let me see my album in kossuth county for sale group only individual pictures . more privacy would be good

this is quite an informative book . writer made it interesting and easy to understand about how to use a pendulum .
lost it's way in the middle , picked up and peaked my interest , but then i just wanted it to end .
i enjoyed the book but the fights between the characters were tiresome . more words required
i guess it will be just fine when i need it . got it for my bullet to be safe .
i use it cook . good for the skin . you can also drinking a tea spoon in the morning burns fat .
i bought these as accessories for my older phone that i had . they worked great when i had the phone .
it , s ok doesn't hide the white stained dried up bug spots like i really wanted
okay book , the build up was good on mystery . but the end was not that interesting . good one time read .
this performs its intended use . the key action is dull and heavy but for the price it is ok . average .
a little cheaply made but works
its okay . not very strong
a bit better then the stock chatterbox headset but definitely not worth the price of dollars that i paid .
this is a good cd , however a lot of the songs were never great hits for foreigner , but it is worth buying
terry blackstone is one of my favorite authors and she did not dissappoint me in this book .
this wasn't what i was expecting . the younger kids don't even play it anymore . not an interesting game at all .
fun book to read . interesting to learn about all that goes on behind the scenes and just who is involved !
this holster fits the bodyguard just fine , but i don't find it very comfortable sticking inside my pants belt .
im probably going with another brand next time as this taste too much like medicine . need something else to crave
there were a few cute spots in the movie but a little on the slow side . the concept was unbelievable .
it was okay . won't need to watch it again .
works as expected ! works just fine . fits my needs . . . . . . . . . . . .
ok
very useful for protecting the screen but makes the touch screen more difficult because of the increase of pressure required .
smaller and tighter than expected . looks ok . construction quality is good . however , would never be confused with an expensive sneaker .
it works with my st gen ipod touch , that's all that mattered to me .
nice pink color . protects banana . cheaper plastic that what is shown . for medium sized bananas . nice addition to lunch bag .
not the feel good type that i was looking for . some may like it , but not me .
the information in this book was well presented i appreciated tina's approach and i wasactually inspired take her advice .
it is a great phone ! although sometimes it works really slow , that is the only complain i have about it

very loud
freaky . enough said . very very freaky . and weird . so very weird and freaky . did i mention acid trip ? wow
i would like easier access to the lock button . otherwise isserves its purpose .
product works well and worth the money . my mistake was that i thought it was a trackball .
more than what we needed . ended up purchasing an electronic piano with advice from musician at church .
it goes on nicely , however with the long lock screw it blocks some of the arrow slots from being used .
baby dislike
this game sort of went down and the strategy guide didn't have much in it . it was pretty bad .
purchased these expecting a soft gel bumper type case but it was a solid plastic and not gel as advertised .

his reference is to the second book . quot one quest , hold the dragons quot

it had most of the songs i remembered when we were young . brings back memories of the good old times .
love the saying and picture but it faded pretty quickly and the picture is only seen on one side .

the item was too large was returned . the return was handled in a timely manner .
the color could be a little brighter .

other than the fact that it was made in china . i well satisified with it . however item was nothing special
i kept it , but the thermometer has never worked accurately .
it works fine , but is way to expensive for let's face it some rubber band and stickers .
haven't used but have other set waiting on the room to be done then the party on . yes thank you !
sold vehicle and did a total tune up and replaced all filters . i can not rate as i have sold vehicle .
this pocketbook has what it takes except it is just a little too small .
it's a quick and easy read . nobody gets hurts or damaged . feel good book where the good guys win . enjoy .
it was a fun series of puzzles . not difficult at all , but there weren't a lot of puzzles to complete .
a good spellbinding book that you don't want to end hard to put down . can not wait for book two
clip not strong enough . other than it's good .
it was okay , so so actingsame ole scares . good on a stormy night with the lights off . predictable ending .
no commit !
altho the cd has good music , it skip in places and the music changes levels while playing .
boycott all publishers who request the disabling of text to speech . while this book is fantastic the publisher obviously is not !
i'm not sure why the product photo shows two bottles , when in fact , all you're getting is just one bottle .
this is a nice looking shoe but runs a bit narrow and doesn't work well for someone withwide feet .
ill keep it simple , liked the gore , story was decent , and it held my interest . good late night slasher movie !
this was a typical regency period book . enjoyable , but does not lead me to read the rest of the series .
could include more information or more codes than it does contain on each section of the app . but it is free
i found this book contained too many words to be used with students who struggle with math concepts .
superbe acting in this bbc adaption of jane eyre ! you never want it to end .
ok but it was a tease i was expecting more . it leaves you thinking that there is more to come .
like the case but the silicone part stretches out quickly .
good story . i enjoyed the conflict between sisters . makes the relationships more interesting . families are all so different . good read
hidden objects are so small and the time allowed to find objects is minimal . i have played better games . disappointed .
some ruins on paper of case . for three stars , disc very clean and had a book inside . d s s
good over all . the grill is not as good as my last weber and the top is a little loose .
expected a few boxes for the price versus just box . will order directly from dr . thompsons website next time .
not a fully developed story . plot not much more than a travelog , interesting along the way but not much more
it is alright . i wish that it would have a few more games that you did not have to purchase
after getting them wet they streched out and work ok
no instructions included measurements are incorrect loop broke off st day quick ship good price
stars its okay . it is not the best but for a dollar who could resist , a good upgrade would help .
fans works well , but are not children's playthings . the paper can easily tear if played with . great for decorating , though .
some very good information from the author , although a bit into himself . it was , however , interesting reading at times .
this book is for a specialized reading group professional musicians , advanced degree students , etc . , but not for the general reader .
pretty predictable . jim accuses everyone he comes across until someone confesses .
kinda light , but does the job . we'll see how long it lasts . just wish it was made in this country .
stories about friends in ireland , whose lives become entwined . relaxing read , gives a warm feeling as one follows the characters
c
just not for me . i like games that challenge my mind . i guess i prefer words games to the gambling type .
a very pretty shoe that is well made and good for dancing . the toe is stiff and rubs a bit .
this stick is much better than the one that comes with slapshot . much easier to use and doesn't fall apart
it was an interesting story , though i thought lengthy for the content . pretty predictable , so it was easy to skim .
it works ok for a basic phone and the price was great . this reply requires eight more words to be complete .
battery works but wished the price was cheaper . same battery as what was in my unit so i bought this .
doggie chewed threw it in months .
it worked fine for what is it . wished the colors were diffrent . boys are not into pink at age .

i am not sure that this is working for my dog . i will update later if i decide it does .
bought cheap came on time and is in the shape i wanted , thanks a a a a a a
a frightening story because it could happen any tick of the clock anytime anywhere . probably too much irrelevent sexual activity
korn is lacking these days
it isn't a game for memaybe others will like it better and give this game more stars then i
the watch seems a little bit big , but its okay . the product looks very nice and its cool to have
very sharp , but doesn't seem to cut any branches over inch . spring coming and will give it another try .
dictatroid . it is a little lacking in operating direction . it requires the speaking to be louder than is normal .
if i wanted a regular smelling almond soap , i would have not purchased this . it should have a stronger scent
bought it as a gift so have not used it myself but the colors appeared a bit dull .

quick read and good characters . finished it fast over a weekend . i'll probably read more of these in the future .
good story showing how easy to be cyberbullied and how devistating it can be but light on what to do .
this approach to the diet was a little extreme for me .
was overwhelmed by all sort of specials only wanted this one item also got quantity wrong not verysatisfactory purchase
compact and convenient for travel . unfortunately , the gray plates covering the outlets started to fall off on the third day .
worked awhile then quit
fair
it was great got there before due time . colors r great ! it fits well ! really like it keep it up
i really think that david attenborough deserves better . shallow and not thoroughly professionally done , especially the interviews with sir david .
good but expected ending . ok if you like love stories and happy endings . plot not very complicated . enjoyable easy read
some of the pockets are very tight and its pretty hard to pull the drivers license out of the slot .
the design and color of the watch is very nice , but did not check the measurements and is very large .
i liked the watch's design but it was hard to read the display in daylight . so moderately satisfied . greg mccann
it was okay , came as described . fits okay , a bit bigger than expected but not bad . i use it often .
its okay . would be nice to be able to chat with our opponents .
i wish this set gave an indication of how tall it will accommodate . its nice just not for shorter people .
yes it was good replaced the previous filter so vacuum cleaner seems better now
but you have to skip over whole chapters that go into every possible detail abouit whales and whaling and whiteness .
my granddaughter figured she could finish it . her daughter was happy with it and the size , so it worked well
do not leave these out in the rain . they will warp like crazy . the legs pop out constantly as well .
small but still too big . lame . walk back kitty slips right out . lb mo old kittens btw .
i primarily bought this for an year old that was living in my house . they enjoyed playing this game .
an intertaining books . a short history of novelity items and a pictorial of many items which brought back plesant memories .
it's true you get what you pay for . overall it is ok but really cheap and cumbersome to carry around .
i put this on and work out on my wii . ronnie milsap at his best . highly recommend .
too bad they dont offer more colors of the outside . only grey . i painted mine black to match my jeep
doesn't have the range necessary to be very useful .
i am sorry to say i have not yet used this product . when i do , a review will be forthcoming !
like his voice the song was really great would like to no more about him sound like he is french
good pan but lid from old pan of same size doesn't fit no problem though i can make it work
this is not a floyd rose ii whammy bar . it's a whammy bar for a licensed by floyd rose tremolo .
it is ok to use for special occasions but not for everyday use . it is very pretty and elegant looking .
if you like to hear families worship together , then this cd is for you . really enjoyed it .
nice looking but doesn't protect the phone . wow i have to use words . no more reviews for me
good for what i needed them to decorate jello . it's a tradition made in mexico . didn't really need the needle
this vibrator is ok . i've had better . the intensity levels are not as powerful as other bullets i've come across .
sturdy durable . does not fit standard size frame . a little too pricey
never finished reading it just didn't hold my attention it seemed to drag . not a mystery book i would recomend .
its plastic when the original screen was glass and came with a small crack in it , its alright i guess .
not exactly as noted there was no mention of only being suitable for us power points . otherwise good . thank you
only worked about one week then died .
these biners were a little smaller than i had anticipated . however , this product has proved quite valuable and versatile . thanks !
expensive but it works wellbought few times and like itas per our rewievs this product works for others too
good bag , but the snaps broke off in the first months . still works , just doesn't close .
fun to you run out of money . wants you to buy more coins but not worth it . buy the paid versioninstead
flimsy . i have affixed them with nylon ties but they tear through the signs pretty quickly . good that it's pack .
this little device helps , but it's still possible to get the cords twisted and tangled on it .
the case appears quite a bit darker gold when it arrives but it works fine and isn't a bad color
the product did not have a memory card enclosed , otherwise it is a good camera .
after the first few jobs the game gets too repetitive . and requires co op friends to play otherwise just very slow .
i order this for my son and he really liked it he is so into cars and he had fun
i bought this for seminary . it's okay , but the truth is the previous version is a much better to me .
good product but causes constipation . good for the purpose purchased . recommend for temporary use , specially after taking antibiotics . good to have at home .
thought it was larger than it really is but it serves it's purpose . has everything that i expected it to .
the cord is a little shorter than the original , otherwise it is working fine . seems like it is good quality .
its a nice blue tooth , if your in quiet surroundings . the inner ear piece is a little big .
provided a look into the past when music was just that . brought back somememories .
nice case , only problem is you cant plug in the charger with this case on just wont fit nice color
it is not too much affect with my problem . so , it is not just which i used it before , it is okay
ok , but nothing out of the ordinary . just another book on the player and not the wisdom of playing poker .
i don't know if it helps with my brother than i but i did take it everyday
it had its moments , but was pretty predictable .
only one port works all the time other one is hit or miss . the idea is great if worked properly .
my husband really liked these pants but they were very tight in the waist . exchanged them for a size up .
they were too long and not comfortable to me so l gave them away , better luck to them i say .
becuz it's live , too much crowd noise to really crank it up . otherwise , good stuff . these reviews require too much
it sheds but that may stop eventually , i hope , it does fit very tightly but i guess that is good ,
felt like i had mini bean bags on my feetnot very comfortable at all would not even consider them again
this was not the quality i expected it to be . it's kind of cheap . but my daughter likes it ok .
good frame good price , would definetly recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive white frame , it's a good buy
sheets are great just not my color so i am returning them
good reading .
wasn't what i had expected , would not recommend this . i would not buy from this author again in the future
i thought the spices would be stronger more like keftastill , i'll use it but wont re order
sort of drawn out . enjoyed all the characters . finally ending i did not anticipate and felt sorrow for all involved .
does fog a bit , but my hubs is still happy with it . he shaves with it in the shower .
i read this book as a standalone book , and it probably would be best to read the other three first .
liked it and it was worth watching . no real surprises in the movie , but it was entertaining . enjoy watching it !
it is not what i thought it would be . but i will keep it and use as a stand by
i bought this as a joke gift for a colleague , but found it less than amusing .
the game is an enjoyable twist on solitaire . however the in app purchases seem a little on the pricey side .
help me how to teach my kids about senses in a short and easy way for then to understand . thanks .
nothing to brag about but a nice film that would be good for hs students . was hoping for more detail .
i hope they will put in the two deleted scenes in the movie someday , so the movie will be uncut .
photo print quality is not good that i expectedand too big size , noisybasic printing quality is fine !
product from verizon works great , the cord is just not as long as i needed it to begalaxy s
probably half the songs use the n word . it is so jarring i found it hard to enjoy the musicianship .
a really fun flick . no oscar here , but good , raunchy fun . jennifer aniston is always number one in my book !
i thought this would fit but it runs small for it's size . i'm usually fit into x .
this item is definitely not a women's , way smaller than a , otherwise they were really nice capris .
it was quite easy to unravel the mystery , butit was still entertaining . i would still recommendit for reading .
too big long chain
not as sharp as advertised , not really sharp at all
i don't normally enjoy novels written in the third person , and this was no exception but has decent political overtones .
it occupies year old nephew and is something to do . must be interesting for me to have something to do .
too small the on the picture , the picture it's look like big but is not , difficult to assembly all equippement
i got this book for my grandson , i just finished reading it and i think he will enjoy it too .
i wish i could have seen this book prior . if i had , i would not have purchased for my grandson .
reduces cravings
danger days was ok . but since then their music has been slipping , and this whole batch simply wasn't as good .
good product for cost
only got this movie because it had close caption . it was okay but to me .
hey i like this app or game what ever you call it this is fun and i hope every one
the case is good for normal use in protecting my tablet . i would not recommend this for outdoor use . nice
this was a good product , nice color , but it would have been better if it have a draw string waist .
it's heavy for its size and hard to handle . otherwise it does a fairly good job on the floors . noisy
works ok but not very strong . does not hold on top of the tape if you tape over the tape .
thank you it realy camein handy for gifts and workedout for everyone thanks you so much for the stylest . cool
kinda cheap material but didn't cost much . pretty colors . so not bad for the money . like it so far bought two of them .
i enjoyed the book . it was a quick read . i loved the different families in the book .
what can i say . if it says stephen king i'll watch it . not my favorite of his movie adaptations .
the book was okay not exceptional but i thought it was too short . would not have gotten it if i had known .
makes a huge mess throwing sugar everywhere . should be used outdoors if you want to avoid making a mess inside .
nice toy . not flexible though , and is hard . so keep that in mind when looking for a real feeling toy .
not great but then again , a very different jim carrey role . entertaining but difficult to follow .
need a little more info on pump model spec info , but all in all not to bad for the price .
got here when they said it would . but battery life is not very long should have got a new one
seems more like a moisturizer , i do not think it is a face primer . glad i ordered the travel size
it's just a skin for my sister's phone 'nuf said ! blah , blah , blabbity blah . blah , blah , blabbity blah . blah .
worked well price not so good s kdfg fi f f r r r yy jj g g h h h
not to bad it keeps me intertwined an my daughter likes it to its cool how u when money nice
not what i thought it was ! should be explained better for the consumers would not buy this item again !
too slow and took me a while to get into it . some aspects were interesting . will continue to finished it .
not that great but jack's from youtube is much better . his feels better in the hand and sounds more realist .
it is made in china , the razor is ok , but i want to buy a razor made in netherlands , so . , just only stars
the author is now the pastor of the friends quaker church that i attend . i enjoy the humor he uses .
the toy wont stay in the table
i bought this hat for my boy friend and he loves it ! i'm thinking of purchasing one for myself
meh . i like a few of the songs , but skip over most . they start to sound the same over time .
couldn't get a good fit
it shot oh ok and is built nice . just use for back yard games . fps is in the which is low
cheap , but effective .
had to reinstall . it crashes again i may change to one star and say its a east of money .
i expected the last printing , and not the earliest edition . but otherwise in pretty good condition aside from some underlining .
packs are small enough to fit in large pocket or purse . essential when traveling where paper is scarce or nonexistent .
. but it gets cold of course and that's what i needed ! i would definitely recommend this product to anyone asking .
i was not happy with the fact that the movie that was sold is letterbox .
this caliper has a wide screen and sturdy build . the metric inch fractions display comes in very handy . no problems with shipping .
well written . a very interesting subject .
cute book but kind of long . it took forever for them to get together . a long story but cute . ok
cool blue light ! a little fragile , but cheap enough if you lose it or someones takes bfd . would re buy !
pretty earrings . came in a cheesy box . smacks of made in china . i thought the mechanism was a little flimsy .
not one of hiaasen's better books , but still good reading . love his warped imagination . looking for more of his books .
product comes on a cd so if you have a new mac installation can become a major issue . be beware .
it has a bit more of an edge than some of there older work .
the bible is the correct version however , it is not the color of leather that i thought i ordered .
ripped after two or three days of wearing . but worked great till then .
i don't like how it skips pages th gggggggggg th g g g catch g h h g v b

thought it was a little more tough then what it was . but it is ok for fun for my dog
have not read it yet ! but will soon . i will let you know . been busy with the holidays and family .
the phone is so close to the ends you have to take the phone out , also the card slots are tight
two clocks same model , but never can set the chime sound , sound at the same time .
interesting but not very good . the author did not offer a good narrative that would have brought the story alive .
good
because of th promotion i choose to buy it . and i found it is just ok , not what i supposed
it is well worth a read . i will finish the series to see the outcome as it peaked my interest .
sorry . i personally think baconreader is a far better app for reddit . this one is nice , but its not br .
it fits the bill as far as lightly protecting your phone but it's not shock absorbing obviously so tread lightly .

the book it's okay . in my opinion there are better potty's train books .
this is good if you are a singer , i somehow ordered the wrong cut . oops ! however it is still the bomb

the rubber outside protects but the harder plastic breaks easily . already on my nd not reordering another phone case .

htc ts tool saver machine cover make sure you measure your machine and buy the next larger size
fair quality for occasional home use . for avid hobbyist or home shop enthusiast , i would look elsewhere .
zipper does not work well
my mistake . i assumed the bells were included . this was just the case . i should have read a little closer !
hint order a size up and hope that you have the body of a model .

for book club . interesting story and educational of a time in our country . but pretty easy reading and somewhat predictable
yes , basic physics a self teaching guide meet my requirments . it's a little harder than i imagined .
nice historical collection of very old nm maps on slick paper . not so good for historical trails in the state .

great product , it worked excelent , the arrival was pretty fast and the quality of the product was the best , thanks
classic movie
fast read . just a classic detective novel . no stephen king time travel fiction
over all a nice piece for x files collectors but not if you want to open and display very limited
always funny . ms davidson definitely has her own style but i , personally prefer supernatural storylines . definitely worth a second look .
the item was nice but it was smaller in size than it appeared in the photograph listed on the page .
cute looking shoes , i like the fact the soles are flexible . they tend to run a bit bigger though .
each of the stories we good if they had each been expanded on and detailed . was a quick hour read .
this pilot started of a bit slow but ultimately was worth watching . i am wondering when the series will continue
repetitive , but interesting . it is a case study so somewhat journalistic decent read but bring another book too .

very good product
i ordered the x , fits well however the waist band is inches too small with no elastic or adjustment .
it was hard getting all the bubbles out . i will try a different one next time . the price was ok .

if you like dragon lance , you should like this book . a good read and a good start to a series .
it's a tight fit for my front sight . this isn't the tools falt i think i need a new sight .
for the price , i thought it would have been a molle holster but i was disappointed that it was not .
solid , if sometimes formulaic middle school aged book series . i loved the egyptian history and knowledges spread throughout the book !
good for a joke gift . cannot comment on usage as it was not purchased for use , only as a joke .
ok serie , lite mycket upprepningar . fullt l auml sbar .
this is what my daughter asked for for christmas . i was disappointed there were not more recipes in this book .
pretty entertaining . i was hoping the sequel would be better but it didn't grab me at all . it seemed formulaic .
this frididaire door shelf worked fine , it fit in the fridge ok and i was glad to replace my shelf .
the towel is nice thick and soft but too big . it seems more like a medium large than a small medium .
the clasp is not my favorite .
love the color but once again some of the beads came loose
i didn't realize how quick it really would be . i was hoping for a more extensive list of actual remedies .
it kept repeating the story line . history repeated itself over and over and over . was glad to reach the end .
this is how i gots to hear my blues this lady brings life to an almost bellyup medium . good stuff !
i'd like to become more familiar with the old negro spirituals . someday i'll take the time to learn them better .

it was ok but not sure i will watch the rest of the shows .
i thought the story was unlikely that these teenagers wouldn't be caught at some point , but still enjoyed the read .
the only thing i don't like is that is shakes when the printer is printing . its not sturdy enough
wish it had the capability to cancel out the on screen keyboard which blocks half the screen . otherwise , works well .
the app is okay but it is a set of double strings . not what i expect for a banjo .
a few character change outs and shallower plot line . it's just not as much fun as the first season was .
pretty good quality , easy to install .
my grand daughter loves the bubble guppies . it was a hit at my house . she plays it all the time .

it was too small !
great price , came fast nice card

playable , nothing fantastic , something to play in between big titles , not worth more than bucks new
got this for three songs really . jack the ripper , rawhide and rumble . wanted commanche but not on this cd .
i expected it to be much taller , other than that it is quite useful . it's sturdy , and serves it' purpose .
good info , not bad for my first book on this topic . i should have read volume one first . would recommend
good basic intro on stockpiling on a tiny budget . i would have liked more details but price was right on .
it keeps you turning the pages but lacks finesse
it was too long to wear with my costume and not quite as poofy as i had hoped .
this case does not have a seperate compartment for the remote control . it's a good case for the price .
this was a pretty good book . i didn't like the ending but it was still good .
while i haven't used it yet . i've found the quality of martha stewart punches excellent and highly recommend it to anyone .
was glad to find this item . can not buy it much anymore and price was greati will buy again .
these are rather snug fitting , so i ended up having to give the large and the x large to my younger son .
the plot was decent . i liked the main character . the rich and power hungry tycoon psychopath was easily hateable . good entertaiment .
these glasses are okay , but not a product i think is worth the price paid .

it was good , but it's from the pastors point of view , and it seems like he embellished a few parts .
they seem to work well but i hadda look up the instructions online . glad i purchased them for sure , though . thanks ! don
loved the scenes of outdoor paris , great shots of landmarks from unusual angles . juliette binoche is gorgeous from any angle !
for basic review of general concepts it is great . great for using while watching tv or your month old .
expected more for the money . is ok but takes a lot of time to makeit work effectively . prefer stackable solution
it's ok , very heavy . i used it for a few day's then moved on to try others . one two three
i was not extremely overwhelmed , simply not me , nor others i had sample . but that is how it goes . tu
could have used far more meat . not his usual style at all even though it was a single kindle edition .

so unbelievable at times i thought i was watching a sci fi movie . i became both proud , mostly and scared . joat
i enjoy the puzzles , but the annoying advertising banner on top blocks part of the first line of the puzzle .
i think it wasn't very realistic . doesn't seem like someone would get married so fast to someone they just met .
it's not soft or hard exactly . the dog likes to be brushed with , but it does not remove much fur .
it was an ok book . it was the right length for a nighttime good night reading book . we enjoyed it .
the case is good , just a little sweat . i recommend it because you can work without having the phone in hand .
they do not stick very long when using on toes after surgery . out in the open they work fine .
rating unfair really since i haven't used it yet .
great way to try some new stuff . without spending a whole lot .
does not provide snug fit for laptop
not what is pictured , this is not an apc battery kit , it is a aftermarket
looks good , works good , but didn't like not being able to transfer apps to the external storage .

the shirt design was nice but i wasn't thrilled with the cut of the shirt . too loose through the body .

medium is too big and small too small . they need to give dimensions so customers can decide what may work .

fast moving and entertaining , simple stories for a warm afternoon , nothing fancy . easy reading no need for heavy thinking . ok ,
nothing that we don't already know ! no new revelations or inside info , and no suggestions to level the playing field .
the item is alright for the price . it stains easily , and turns brown from the heat after the first use .
unfortunately i doubt this item was new either . also the case was broken . i'm a big fan of folk music .
again , it states it has episodes but i have yet to see any . it is all video clips . so aggravating .
this was for my daughter so i really cant say anything about it . all though she has not complained .

i would have liked a better quality t shirt . it is too lightweight . i don't think it will last very long .
the quality of this product was less than i expected .
not funny , but rather what elements make things humorous . if you need to know why you laugh , read it now .
thought it would have more on modern sets using steel traps and snares . this book is mainly about using deadfalls .
product was great , it just cost way to much to ship this little pack of gum , never agaion . thank youstephanie cadigan
i would have liked more in the bag guess i should have ordered . i wish they had other shapes
too expensive for a piece of plastic . it is ok but i will not purchase this again in the future .
not as much action as before . seems they wanted more of a story line . but hey it's the wolverine anyway .
it was good but very predictable ! i also thought it was very unrealistic . they had escalators in the school ! what ?
needed a surport for under the handle of my larger knives other than that it worked well .
it is easy to tell that this is cussler's first pitt novel . his writing hasn't matured at this point .
adequate quality , but the zipper is cheap and doesn't slide smoothly .
quirky view of the world through a dog's eyes . sometimes it's sad , often humorous , always a simpler view of life .
i like the advice , but he's very crude .
but a little weak on bass . you'll need a sub woofer . nice features
i thought it was too predictable . it was more like a spiced up harlican romance . shades of gray much better .
the information was a little bit off , but i enjoyed the material for the most part .
it was alright . not what i was looking for . better for the artsy people of our community is my guess .
i like playing . i use it to pass the time . also it is something that my kids can play together .
pretty pictures but difficult to maneuver the pieces and difficult to stabilize the board as i move the pieces around
the plot could have been better but i loved all the action scenes .
no teeth to hold them in place
i am a fan of the murder club . entertaining , suspenseful and a good easy read . get acquainted with the club .
this product is great not hard to put up my thirteen year old son put it together .
this is a big work and it will take time to read . not a quick work . i will keep this book
we thought the colors would be softer blues and greens but in fact are much brighter in the actual piece .
two out of the four looked professionally made . the other two were not detailed .
good compilation , nice to have , not a must have . not disappointed with this book , just not a rave for me .
so i played this and i would give such a good answer and it was wrongit's dumb don't recommend this .
colors are true to what they show . too watery , it takes a lot of makeup to get good coverage .
i've really enjoyed the crazy series . however , this book was my least favorite of the bunch .
my fault for not realizing the dimensions would make this adorable beanie a little too small for my kindle fire .
a quick read for those just starting out on trying to eliminate or reduce toxins in their food and environment .
the app works on my fire . there are very few clips to watch unless you subscribe and have a code .
this book was recommended by my instructor but its lacking without audio cd for pronunciation of the words and sentences
i recieved the cabinet with a broken middle shelf and have had no response from amazon , target or the manufacturer .
cute but realize that the sea urchins are really really small in size
i enjoy mahjong , but these games were a bit too easy . good for young children . fun incorporation of alice wonderland story .
do not like the waist band as well as i though but will go ahead and try them any way
good for indoors maybe but too small for outdoor work . returned it for a larger model which works just fine .
otherwise , okay . really disappointed . had a russell shirt years ago and it held up well . good enough to not send back .
this tool is ok for light clogs . you'll need two people and a lot of patience for any other problem .
he is getting a bit long winded if i say so myself . but still worth a read .
it was an okay read .
took quite long to come but arrived as was said during estimated arrival time and was in good condition
the product is just o . k . it works fairly well on windows but that is about all .
for the girls at home is okay . althought the price is a little expensive . but what else can we do ?
i have not put into use yet , but the ones i am replacing were double the thickness very good price
buy one or two sizes bigger
it works fine . but this is my second one and the case starts cracking then eventually cracks all the way
the guy is ridiculously talented but , i could have gotten into hearing some better songs . i missed vocals in this case .
book not in good condition

the app keeps freezing as you advance to higher levelswould definitely be a great game if it worked properly
product does work well , kept my 'areas protected but has a little scent to it that i did not like .
it was not what i was expecting . i like a game with a bit more of a challenge to it .
it wasok to small for my laptop , do you have anything biger it was also too flimsy fo my taste
not as sturdy as i thought it would be . one side is a bit scrunched . my files did fit well .
very short story . ended abruptly . it would have been nice to have more content connecting the beginning to the end .
the phone is a bit too crowded . the buttons are hard to read and are too close together .
not so much .
i was impressed with game graphics and league offerings but difficult to hold tablet and control players at same time .
everything can be sold by images but when you get the product it is too late the item is cheap .
it's ok . i was a little disappointed in the quality but it's a good deal for the price .
if you have read other information on this subject , there will be some repetition . always good to read and learn !
this was for a bday gift so didn't get a chance to test it out .
these pads were cheaper than others which is probably why they can't take care of a chihuahua's potty breaks .

bought it for large bubbles , but doesnt work well for anything but the wand that comes with it

they are see through , so keep that in mind when buying . they are very comfortable though .

did not power on at first . need better instructions . did finally work though . spend a little more and be happier .
convenient but not very cold . these did seem to help but i didn't use them for very long .
the molding quality was below oem new with significant raised seams . the quality otherwise seems good and the price was right .

narrow fit .
disappointed much smaller than picture shows . may want to add size on ad . or size pics can be used .
the information repeated itself often , but the book overall was insightful and educational .
it didn't fit my spiritual outlook . compared life to avatars computer games . might be good reading for people who do games .
very well written and comprehensive , but i prefer guidebooks with more photography , maps and graphics . this volume is very text heavy .

ok information of you have never made big meals worth left overs before . otherwise not worth the five minute read .

the first laptops i received were defective . fame pc sent a rd laptop that is working well now . hurray
it allowed me to easily stop a leaking valve without having to remove replace the entire valve which is a pain .
received item quickly , however the safety seal top was not sealed on any of the i bought .
i was expecting something different , thought it would be easier for a lay person could relate to and understand .

need track listings and you will sell rs import
the product only lasted until this month . not sure when i purchased it , but had hoped for longer life !
i enjoyed the story . the book started out with a basic idea that was written well . the characters were believable .
