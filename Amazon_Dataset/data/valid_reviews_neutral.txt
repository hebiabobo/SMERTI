this movie is not nearly as good as you would expect from the cast . kinda cheesy throughout most of it .
this is a nice light hearted read , a nice change of pace from the darker stuff i have been reading
was a good rainy day read . enjoyed it's pace and will definitely read more of deanna's books in the future .
but the cover art is simply terrible . even i could have done a better job with photoshop or something .
the title caught me a little bit off guard . this was not the book i intended to order . my mistake .
this screen protector didn't fit the phone exactly , i had to cut it in order for it to fit right .
insightful . a bit pessimistic at times . but also candid . a valuable read for those of us seeking a lasting relationship .
purchased this because my daughter says it the best coffee around . i wasn't impresssed . there are others i like better .
very nice looking product but the tea is very old i believe , has very little flavor .
its ok
was ok , i read through it fairly fast , do not like the cover , but hey that is my own opinion .
sturdy and works well . top is very pretty but the part under the collar the metal stick looks very cheap .
no wonder miracle just another cream , did not notice expected results . may continuos use makes work but i doubt it .
i prefer the peeled option but i'm glad that i've tried both now . soaking this version overnight helps a lot .
i expected a comedy but it was more of a lite drama . not a bad movie with a good story .
. it may have helped my arthritic knee , but my knee doesn't always hurt . it did not help my elbow tendinitis .
i enjoyed the movie but i did not care for the ending it seemed incomplete and left me wanting more .
good one
an esthetician i do recommend , but i do not like the feel and look afterwards
they were okay
thought was bigger but it's very tiny
i like the fact the quantity you get for the price . the covers work great for a short period of time .
the stockings were exactly what i needed , but the size was not . my mistake ! good value but could not use .
didn't enjoy as much as some other books . i am a fan of scott sheoerd but this was not his best . dick beeson
its ok for the i paid . the watch feels cheap when you hold it . this is a large watch .
just as describe . fits the bonsai nicely .
this is a pretty bracelet and someone else might like it , but it didn't have enough sparkle for me .
this thing is freakin' huge . it's okay if you're going to use it only at home , but portable , it ain't .
a decent movie worth seeing if you can't figure out what else to watch . very good acting especially by cusack .
colors could be more vibrant and the slits could be wider . i had a difficult time inserting paracord through them .
pan cooks fine but it stained pretty badly after the first use .
i would like to magnified the brief review of obove mention book , please do me a favor
this inexpensive line connects my pc to panasonic bluray player bd unit for streaming movies via netflix . fast and convenient .
book very simple , requiring more information in diagrams easy to record . it is a book very little didactic . excessively simple and very incomplete
fits but not as snug as i had hoped . good product and safe .
very light , not great for the beach . a light breeze will blow it away . not what i expected . very disappointed
i expected a lots . but it''s just okey stuff . i am looking for another one . i can't trust review anymore .
guess i just don't get it . mystic tales that are supposed to have a point , but it's beyond me .
loved hunger games series this series is no where near as good . i'm actually having a tough time getting through it .
i chose this rating because even though fit well the boots seem cheaply made i was expecting better quality . t
a few cups were warped or squished and unusable . the ones that were not broken worked great for party cups !
it was a bit disappointing . it was very hard to get into theheart and soul of the book . didn't finish .
for a die hard wheel horse fan . it did the trickotherwise just a cheap clock to hang on the wall .
i usually enjoy faye kellerman but the mystery wasn't anything special and the storyline with gabe and yasmine is insipid .
it looks perfect but actually this product is hard to care . it seldom help me to protect my macbook . i
fascinating , but gets tedious after awhile , when the same activities repeat themselves over several decades . may have been a short story .
works well , but the sound quality is lacking , not very sharp clear reception . very ease to use once paired with phone
it was a great case it just isnt really orange its kind of a peach colour , a tad bit disappointing
the seasoning is too heavy . i will eat them , but only because i ordered a bunch .
the xbox is okay . it was a christmas present for someone else . the headphones were broken when we received it .
still reading the book . i havent had much time to do any reading . will update when i finish the book
i guess it was ok , some i did not get and i am a kid and it said for kids
it was ok but didn't have enough room for everything .
not too bad . seems pretty solid . i like it . and it looks quite nicei had no issues with it .
takes a long time to ship if you don't pay extra to get it to you . it's worth the price .
i love the graphics on this calendar , but the date spaces and numbers need to be larger .
not bad but the volume sounds little low . everything else is fine looks good . for the price its good buy .
very cute . but took forever to show up . but worth the wait for the price . kinda worried about lead though .
i can not say that i saw any difference , so i did not reorder . i saw no difference . was disappointed .
much less sensitive than a wired mouse . good for general use , but not good enough for gaming or precise work .
it still needs to be tweeked which is quite difficult
could be better but gets the job done
it was fun to listen to during the holidays . it made the atmosphere more cheery . i enjoyed it very much .
mr toad survived years living out doors then he broke down . me sad , i am very very sad
the sleeve very tight and too long
i like this type of game it is a fair copy of space invaders no more words to say grrrrr
quality of this product is bellow average . i was not satisfied . i hope you will sell better product . m . mosley
it works but is a little difficult to use because the software is awkward
it's okay . i read other books that were better . very short book . i would suggest other readings before this book .
ok but just very small and didn't hold cord very well . would have liked it to be a bit larger .
i did not read the previous issues leading to this but was a good middle act . tempted to buy conclusion
comfortable , nice color , but the fabric pills like crazy . it's not a shirt that will last .
was not quite what i expected . i thought they would be singing the old gospel music like they used to .
i like ben's previous work much better . but thats just my opinion .
the red paint on the cardinal left alot to be desired . next spring i intent to paint the red myself . dt
it's ok , but i like using the google authenticator instead .
very good cd compared to most music out today but it is highly overated .
too large . returned . size in ape .
now with crazy american voices . not as good . b
i wanted more . even though it was a short story the dialoguewas good . just expected more out of the story line
enjoyed the period settings and the set up for the plot , but i feel asleep before the movie ended . sorry .
not very exciting . and a lot of repeating of the same thing . had potential but fell short in my opinion .
i like these kind of books but this just was not for me . it was slow .
the only problem was the ring size was too tight on my finger . i've gained weight . thank you any way .
ok however i probably won't be purchasing it again . i only purchased it for a christmas gift for a teenager .
prompt deliverylong and drawn outdoes explain sadcan get same information from the internetpublished material is not current
works pretty well , though gobbles up v batteries , so hopefully you have a plug near by !
cute at first but never use , deleted it to save space .
after washing these a few times they have a fall apart .
this is the source of randall moir's window glass analysis method that is most easily accessed .
its not good for kindle because , you cant write in it . otherwise it gives good advice , and also has funny stories
didn't fit on my car i
it's not a bad game , but i do like the idea of playing random players , it beats playing by yourself .
my first in the series . if the writer can keep up this speed i will probably order the entire series
typical maupin circa . good story , interesting twists , moving but i miss the earlier dramas , variety of characters and surprises
the music of this cd is a nice representation of the music of nicaragua .
i laughed out loud in a few spots . looking forward to reading the other three books in the mercury series .
buy the book , cd's are not necessary . sylvia doesn't have the right voice for meditation tapes .
interesting read , but some of plot is a little unrealistic like science fiction . recommend to all lee child fans .
it cost too much , but if you really need it , is a good option . is the original part so it's expensive .
i have not had to change the ink refill yet , but i'm sure these will be fine .
tried it , it ok
just ok
it is remanufacturing . it looks like it has been refilled . it comes with dirty bag , but it works .
book arrived very quickly . great service again . thank you so much .

this does not sound like green day at all but more like devo . its good but not what i expected .
product was fine . shipping was great . movie is eh .
just did not like the content and it was a slow read and i just gave up on reading it .
they fit fine , however , i would have preferred a little more padding . they are a bit thin for my taste .
it's ok i like the other jazz one betternot enough bass in musicmore bass more bass in the music
i would like one of thw clasp sides to be more solid so one hand can easly align and snap
color received was unknown at purchase . packaging was sub par torn . gloves appear to be good quality . i would recommend the product .
play this its fun but it say this app needs internet when i put it right next to the internet
i give the books that she originally wrote under mary kay andrews stars . these are not as good .
this biography was a pleasant read . it was gifted to friend of the author . contains nice photos and family history .
this pointer is compact and works well , but the metal is pliable and when full extended could be easily bent .
doesnt hold a charge very long but it was very cheap . good to have in emergency for sure . better ones out there
very thin , hard to handle .
i can't recall what this book was about
good
the quality of the product is great , nice shape , everything . it is just slight smaller than i had previousy envisioned .
good read . short and very predictable . not bad for a free read . i would recommend to a beginner . not too bad .

my granddaughter like this game
. you see colin firth's bum two lovely times . need i say more ?
it is a good manual . but it does not go in to detail on my zx r .
very nice but a bit pricey . well packaged and overall my adult daughter loved it !
great information , but i didn't know it was made with a low ink printer cartridge . much of it was unreadable .
it works so far , i like the led light .
this is extremely entertaining , but the author doesn't have the background or authority to guaranty any of it is true .
great show , but when will episode be on amazon instant video ?
the product was cute and the fut was good , but it started peeling a few weeks after i got it .
good taste , but they are so small . good for when you just have to have a cookie .
kool but its too small .
much smaller than i had thought they would be , but decent enogh toy , just little
not heavy duty enough for my second graders . they began to tear a few days later . particularly in the pocket .
nice product for the price its a little hard to keep on but other than that its a fine product
there's no nugget in this game just wonder around and go through levels . some of the jumps are unnecessarily hard .
the product is of low quality .
this started out great but got a bit wishy washy in the middle . surprise ending though which saved the day .
it's ok it still doesn't hold a charge , but i think it is my phone , which i will replace shortly .

fast shipping

product was fine , packaging fine , price fine , but it took a long time to reach me .

the kids don't pay that much attention to it , just the squirrel . they find it uncomfortable to play with it .
pretty good investigation into the mystery behind obamas colleagues , parents , and his true motives as president . quiet convincing and provocative .

the color of the bag is super dark almost wine , otherwise its a nice tote bag but wrong picture color !
the ropes included are too short and immediately fray .
this was a good read . i enjoyed the little glimpse in the main characters life . i enjoyed the break . nice
this dress is a bit too short , the fit otherwise is ok . i would have preferred a bit more length
what can you say it works , clips on to side of pitcher easily , but the storage case is sucky !
color not as described ! after writing to the seller , he did offer to take it back and reimburse me .
i thought the description said it was for all swiss army watches but this did not fit my model .
well worked by the main character , but i expected a bit of more action .
like this product is elastica is necessary ask for a biguer size . the quality is god and the presentation correct
i did not expect goliath to have so much hair . my baby keeps putting the hair in his mouth .

missed the first series so i am sure there are some missing tie ins but still fun to read
ehh , but price is right
i was impressed with the speed of the products deliver , but somewhat dissapointed in the quality of the products scans .
faulty connections , had to send it back for a new one
this item was not what i expected . i was expecting something a little different , but it will do for now .
it was fine at first then it stopped working and i can't turn it on
leaks
sizes run smaller than advertised . the staff was polite when i called and they refunded the money without a problem .
it was good product for my lap top that i have to use it to view programs in my tv .
it wasn't really what i was looking for . i thought it would be more of a journal than anything .
nice looking but they hurt my feet ! the toe area is where they hurt , other then that they were nice !
not as much detail about carnegie himself . kind of glossed over a lot of his life in my opinion . not very exciting
my two year old daughter enjoyed the story and colors on the pages . this was an okay read for free .

i really like this movie even with the subtitles . but its not very scary because of the subtitles . who too
. i thought this was a good song . i've listened to it twice , and i've lost that loving feeling i guess .
i was disappointed with these puzzles . i prefer straight forward jigsaw puzzles . there is no challenge to putting blocks together
but is cheap made and overheats if you use the computer at the same time , burns out after a year
they are ok , you have to make sure they are the correct size , sometimes a large really means extra large .
i like this product , however , some of the jewels fall off , so you need to treat it with clear coat .
bold lettering and very noticable but the adhesive backing is not very strong .
not what i expected material was a little flimsy and shirt wasnt as long as the jerseys i am used to .
common sense information to decipher on an individual basis to find out if being an expat is realistic . good read .
dressed smelled and quaility is poor but for price what can you expect will try to jazz up to wear
nice looking boots but heel is much higher than stated in description . actual heel is about . . may return them .
these eventually start to wear , but they lasted quite a long time and are worth their purchase price for sure .
nothing to describe these sleeves shipped with the cd order i placed .
this game is okay just something to pass time . i would not pay for this game . glad it was free

this movie really shows you how men thing . my husdand and i really enjoyed the movie . the ending was disappointing .
after seeing seven samurai , this movie is ok , i was hoping more out of it , but it's ok .
the cut was a little different on this pair so they weren't as loose fit as they should have been .
takes a little time with a short learning curve . does a good job on schnauzer's extra fine leg and stomach coat .
while this story was often interesting , the narrative format caused it to bog down and be difficult to wade through .
very thin , sharp blade good for light duty work . for under , it's worth the price .
book itself was brand new in packaging , but the shipping took about a week longer than it was supposed to
great game . really fun to play when boredyou should give it a tryonly problem is you have to buy coins
i ordered a few dvd's at once but this one took considerable longer that all the others .
this imitation maple extract has good flavor but will lose it's flavor over time if its not used rather quickly .

packaging crushed upon arrival . tube was only full .
though the story seemed disjointed in some parts , overall this book is an enjoyable read . recommend for dee henderson fans .

it was promised batteries but it is not batteries includedit was promised batteries but it is not batteries included
i was hoping it would help more with my neck pain which it hasn't yet but it is very comfortable .
is what it is . i needed a spare hdmi cable and found this one to be the best deal . thanx !
although this book is clearly british it can be useful to us on this side of the pond . good read .
the temperature gauge works fine , but the humidity gauge does not work , and the time is almost impossible to regulate .
really nice and girly . wish it was a tiny bit looser though . colours and make are really good .
great comedy dvd and it came on time as notified with out any issues . this is a must recommend dvd .
not well constructed . it was torn on our first trip
my kids love it wish there was more for free . i like that its got games for each age level

good book . i would recommend every man and boy read it . also a good book for the ladies to read .
i didn't really see any changes as a result of taking this . however , i didn't resume after the days .
they are gorge . boots but the plastic is so obviousand the heel is sooo gummy like it bends like nothing
the tape was not completely round because it was bent out of shape some . guess it will still work o . k .
they r very small but i made due with them for what i needed since they were of great quality .
my cat still has some gi problems , but they could be way worse . so i guess this product is working ?
good book but it starts off increasingly slow and the kindle version is a bit dicouraging with over pages
loved the pants but after one wash with detergent and nothing else and no bleach involved , i had orange spots .
it is a decent wrap but for my needs i wish it was stiffer in the support of the wrist .
not good for dishwasher use due to heavy indentation at the bottom where water pools .
can't find and change chapters easilyother versions of bible allow easy access to chapters and verse . not this one
enjoyed what i've read so far , but haven't finished it . steve jobs was a marketing genius with a big ego .
interesante y divertido pero definitivamente alargado , libros es mas que suficiente para una historia que al final se siente repetitiva .
my family uses this not only for hamburgers , but also for egg muffins . works very nicely , but is somewhat flimsy .
it was ok . good for younger teen girls . not my favorite but it was a quick read so it kept my interest .
the stand on the back sometimes pops open . does not stay closed . wished it had a latch . but other wise case is good .
enjoyed reading and concept . characters where well developed and changing protagonists interesting although sometimes confusing . finish seemed to get lost .
very cheaply made . didn't last long .
perhaps more than one needs to know about one of he most beastial organizations in history , but worthy historical content
great comfortable . not for the beach or around dirt . it traps debris understrap and rubs your foot raw .
expands my current lens options with minimal cost . glad i went this way and recommend for others to use
works ok only flaw is that you can hear a lot of static noise other than that it works fine .
i enjoyed the book and frankly i thought the film was not up to par . there are better action movies .
some of the quotes in here were motivational , but i was expecting more out of a book with this title .
service was prompt , got my book in a timely manner . didn't expect book to be so old though .
great design but he interior markings wear off with use negating the purpose .
really thought this would give a good astringent like feeling especially when applying to the scalp . sadly it does not . expected more .
it does the job providing power , however it takes about addition minutes to start . and the cord is short .
okay . its simple enough to use but i dont know , i think i like the phone mobile version much better .
i had a small water brush but this medium is a tad bigger . a perfect addition to my set . thank you .
lone survivor is much better , this is very sporadic
one of the blue plastic tools broke almost immediately , but the rest were fine and did the job .
it is not good and not bad , it is made from plastic but easy to proken
thought there might have been a little more stuffing inside , for the price , rich color . no obvious flaws or anything .
first cd is great stars second cd , first half is good third cd shouldn't even be here .
these are like mini pinch holders . i was expecting them to be a bit bigger . still useful , but not great .
i ordered the reference material as a refresher to information . it serves the purpose and is useful . thank you .
product came prompted but didn't receive a phrasebook as stated on the dvd . which was kind of a bummer .
i enjoyed the read . it isn't a classic but for a lighter note it was fun . the characters were entertaining .
an interesting story but unfortunately not very well written , the style is often clumsy . but the characters are well portrayed .
easy to use , setup and convert videos to pc . the problem is regarding battery life . average rate is good .
the book was a good reminder at how easy it is to sneak in healthy food
not my cup of tea . don't think i would recommend it to the people i know who read . sorry !
weren't the correct ones for the device i have but that was my fault . i should have viewed the pictures better .
sometime's doesn't want to sync . i just unplug it and plug it back in and it seems to be ok .
i expected the kindle version to have live links and it does not . i was disappointed . otherwise it was fine .
the elastic makes the waste a little loose and has to be cinchedan extra notch or two to stay tight .
i got this battery as a back up for my phone . it works and i haven't had any problems with it .
this was an ok story . the same old she forgives him and than takes him back like nothing ever happened .

good product quality . make sure you measure your bbq before you buy this was smaller than i had expected .
very heavy , weighs more than the two little dogs that i bought it for . i do like the concept , however .
this movie was alittle slow but very good . up until the very bad ending .
just an okay story . not a page turner .
it was a good book . very interesting . enjoyed reading it . i finished it in a week , a very catchy book .

love the swimsuit but the top is very small . i had to buy another too to got with the bottoms
i had to take one more pill than recommended in order for it to work good as the brand name .

quick comment . i thought it would be a little softer and piece otherwise it is very good to excellent .
no miracle , does make it feel a little better . could be placebo .
easy read . keeps the reader's interest . wonder how close to reality it is ? ! can't wait to begin reading the sequel
does the job not as nice looking as i had hoped in the location i used the mats i bought
it was okay . it being a short story with a lot of people with input made it not that good .
put this on my new kindle fire and seems to be doing what it's supposed to do ! sure hope so !
enjoyed the app but too many things in it to spend money on .
the quality is good . however , the tape is not . the treads do not stick very well to the tape .
works ok . needs more power .
after only a few wears , the eyelets that hold the shoe strings in place broke . not a very durable shoe
good enough just a little too small for my car im building a cen ct s and they almost don't work .

i enjoyed this book . the author is to be commended for the laborious amount of research he must have done !
i have words for this product with my phone htc touch pro static and echo .
cap is a bit too sophisticated and one broke immediately . i would prefer simpler caps .

the poster is great , but i wished the cards covered more basic items , instead of the animal categories . otherwise nice .

very nice case , with cute color . the quality is ok , but it is not good enough for holding mutiple cards
fun as hell but too damn spensive
the plot is hilarious ! i think everyone should at least give it a try ! the characters make it worth it !
good police drama . religious undertones not so subtly hidden . typical broken cop getting a second chance . word word word word
i have ordered many old time movies tv shows from amazon but this is good one it is ok
it made me think how these little flashes of memories past are very much a part of my own life .
this book is interestingly written but really slow to get to any action , ends well but a very long ride .
very interesting until it just keeps dragging on and on about things almost fell asleep didn't finish this book . sorry .
hard for a year old to navigate . maybe some additional directions . would help . spent limited time first time around . will try again thanks
these used to be stunningly good . they have done something to make them good but more ordinary in quality . .
the item fits too close to the body . not what i was looking expecting .

much more difficult to navigate than a nook !
it's a trivet . i would not buy again but it's ok .

this mirror fits and works great . it is not the highest quality but it works as a good aftermarket replacement .
i can't complain about his sound . i like this cd but i've heard other songs he sang that were better .
interesting but a bit crassly written , in my opinion .

leather case itself is ok . don't like the graphic that much because the printing is not high quality . . .
british program sometimes misses the mark . . could do better and most of the cast has in other programs . .
medium quality . worth the twenty dollars . wash out lint before using for everyday not fluffy or for decorative guest towels .

it works pretty good , but i can't stand the tingle . i can't argue with the results though .
well the product looks just like the picture however it is not easy to get the product linked for use .
this is more floral flowery then fruity smelling . i prefer the original hempz lotion smell , which is more fruity coconut smelling .
nice waltz good pace for basic waltz .

read the title anyway nothing too exciting here just another pop diva in the britney christina tradition trying to cash in .
i couldn't even tell years had passed . i was really quite shocked when the end of the movie came .
fun and can be challenging , would probably suggest this game to other people . would like more categories to choose from

it performs as advertised , however it is a bit shorter than i expected . cant beat the price though .
i really enjoyed the album but there were only a few songs that i would go back and listen to .
it works well on light mats , but if they are thick there is no way you can get this through .
this is for young romantics only . typical uninspiring story and not well written . errors in grammar only made it worse .
i bought this for my daughter she loves to do her hail and this is simple and easy to use .
an enjoyable read when i want a cozy type mystery . i would recommend it to others for that very reason .
this is a large heating pad but it is not very flexible and does not get very warm .
topic revisited . corruption in high places . flawed detective , drugs , death and redemption . characters with some dimension worth expanding . broaden perspectives .
the premise was absurd . the characters were out of a grade b movie . just a big letdown after browns prior work
the pictures look much cooler than the actual case . very faint glow for a short period of time , pretty lightweight
straps across the foot is extremely tight ! not at all tue to size . very nice shoe to be in heel

it was a gift , didn't watch it . she loves it .
heard there were some good scenes in here for the star of zero dark , but didn't really see them .
great games for the little ones but turn off the adds . spoils their excitement when they hit the ad box .
writing , characters , story line all mediocre . won't waste my time on any more of the series . hopefully , her others are better .
plug n charger fell apart n days . got tape holding it together and still works . haven't tryed car charger
good for the price .
it was fun reading . i like how the books have different story lines and still connect with the other books
the smell of it is good , however it only lasts for couple of hours , especially in the hot weather here .
awesome product i just wish i could find the refills for reasonable price !
great price . seal on some blister packs was broken , but charge was full .
the sparkles tend to fall off after a while and it's hard to open to get it off the phone .
so far not a bad phone . lightweight and easy to use . lcd not bright enough or clear to read . ok
didn't give the depth expected but was worth the minutes . no true details were provided , but sheer common sense .
not great , worth the time if looking for something to do , good characters acting and special effects .
a little disappointed . written in the s , some of the 'futuristic' items were less than credible . the philosophy was interesting .
it ok a little hard to use on the phone it makes using the keyboard a little difficult to use
for takes you to a pleasent journey and easy reading for the adults . if you like romance with spice .
cool game . more international logos are needed . some logos need to be updated . would recommend to a friend . thank you !
the battery is poor , so the charging . it discharges even without use so there is need for improvement on this .

very good product not so tough , perfect size perfect weight , needs a longer usb cable and a hard carrying case .
it was cute enough but totally not what i thought i was buying based on the picture .
these were not the fluffy sheepskin i was expecting but rather a coarser material . they work fine in boots though .

i like some of the songs , but i was not a fan of this cd .
this is a good sexy short read . enjoyed the chemistry between the two characters and felt it was well written .
it was very surprising at times . overall it was pretty good . i will definitely be reading moore from this author .
i thought it would be an often referred to reference book , but i have not even needed it yet .
the toilet seat was just as advertised . beautiful yet not as sturdy as i'd hoped .
not bad , a bit fluffy in spots and needing a better editor , but entertaining . like ted dekker feeling very mellow .
expensive for what it is
from the description i thought it would be newer than it was . but , looks aren't everything because it does work .
the card holder doesn't hold up well . thread is coming loose and cards are falling out .
i was expecting the funner part to be smaller , i guess i can use it for something around the house

they are much smaller when you get them . pay attention to the size .
the scots can't be this bizarre . come to think of it , neither can the americans .
good as a backup drive enclosure . horrible network speeds not a good network storage box
this little thing does its job the only thing is that the pole broke off but we still use it .
i bought this product for my yeare old daughter but the helmet was too small to fit her
good braid but it looks more purple than pink . it does look to be strong enough for my fishing needs .
it doesn't fit quite like how i would like it to . i'm a size c and i got the xl .
not anywhere near pieces !
good concept but needs more solar power and a better fan to really cool the car .
the book was kind of boring i kind of got lost in it but overall it was a good book
i liked the game , but i beat it in days , it would have been better if it were longer .
it works for a couple of days but doesn't last very long .
showed i downloaded it but could not find it . don't know how it works .

gotta really pay attention but the story is good . the conversation in russian has sub titles but it's not overwhelming .
the picture on tv was too speckley and it had to be powered which means more wires to hook up .
it was a hit for a gag gift but there should be more sizes other than one size fits none .

i heard the song on radio and liked it very much . i ordered it and am very happy with it .
it was thicker than i expected . may be good or bad , but it doesn't fit my dock or carry pouch .
zero complaints here . could not have asked for a fab item
helpful but i need more details , for my study cases . otherwise is good . keep adding more books like this one .
it was a little big and with my brothers recent amputation the pouch would swing and hit his leg
i like the idea , interesting design , but just not for me
i got these for my daughter , she says they are just ok . she can be very picky .
these knives stick pretty easy unless it rips the bark off the tree . but nothing extraordinary about them

this game is very fun but it desperately needs updates . you can also get bored of this game easily . bye
great umbrella , but if you pull in the wrong spot to adjust it will break in half .
they are about at wal mart . fun but may not last long . keep some extras handy and extra batteries
this book has some great content but really needs the aid of a designer to make it functional .
it was ok . the skin is realistic the coloring is nice . the movement is not as good as i expected .
beautiful music
the pump is what i expected . it must be i placed in the sun .
if you like dramas this is one that is above average and james woods gives an excellent performance as well .

. they put a little label on it that is not easily removable . acetone to the rescue .

seems well writen and inclusive but i have not tried any of the ideas yet . get back to me later .
i have used other jose eber that were better . just expected more that's all . will stick to my other brand .
and they were okay , this series looks a bit predictable , maybe i should watch all of this dvd first .
disappointed in the battery life when the monitor is unplugged . other than that , it's fantastic value .
this book has good information for anyone in the workfoce , but is very short , almost like a quick tip guide .
i missed ranger , he wasn't in this book much . i liked it had a good story and kept me interested .
the pink ones turned out maroon . the lime green was a grass dark green . works fine though ! good grip easy to assemble
too many characters to follow and too far fetched , couldn't wait to get to the end , the usual expected ending .
its sturdy , it serves my purpose of putting my ehd in it , sturdy and easy to bring along . very handy
it really isn't srong or balanced enogh to hold a standar parakeet cage securely . it was easy to put together , though .
everyone has to moan just to moan . i downloaded it cause it is free . i am sure it will improve .
i usually order a large , these run larger . the material is really thin , they are perfect for lounging or exercise .

it is a fair light . pretty bright . battery time not as long as i would think from led
mr . coffee , the brew machine is slow from start to finish . other than that its fine . its compact and lightweight .
bought this to put in our church library as we have some other books in there by this same author .
the charts was missing but it was somewhat helpful . i really needed the math part so overall it was fine
what attracted me to these were the colors . unfortunately , the watch did not work . battery or something else . i sadly returned .
still a good read but a little more story and a little less action would have suited me just find
it looks like the picture , fits like a tank top . was a good price of a tank top , and came fast
the koolatron cooler only cools drinks down to degrees farenheit . not cold enough to enjoy drinks at that temperature .
it's okay it's to small . and i don't use it a lot fear of breaking it . but a good one
interesting story . needs to be told love judy , a nice change from the shotumups would recommend it to a friend
these are cheaper at target for the exact same thing
it's not what i thought it would be , but it's okay . it comes in handy with my bible study group .
very heavy duty . its ok
okay
this show it's pretty funny . when you need a lift , turn it on . the episodes are short and sweet . enjoy .
the mix has a good flavor but does not make very many bottles of soda for what it costs .
this book was missing pages . and had duplicate pages for !
too much music in background . been hunting a lot of times , but never heard music .
a little smaller than expected . phone doesn't fit good , have to cram it in .
the picture quality is quite poor and the exercises are a bit underwhelming . it's ok , but i wouldn't recommend it .
watch looks nice . however , the chronograph does not reset correctly . always stops at or and not in .
she likes more bouncy balls better , harder rubber and very chewy . these will do for now . nothing else to add to the review .
there are different options for play and different options on your turn , so it is great for the whole family .
too much sex for me but thats just my thoughts . did enjoy the story . will not buy her books again
its works . but it doesnt when you need it to . no wifi not service no emergency calling either ? ! what the heck
tool is ok for the price but not very durable . plastic chipped a little on the first day of use .
i had to send these back because they were too small for my husband and he wears a size .
it seems mainly about rhyming . the first part does a little math but i thought there would be math throughout
very cheaply made and could be a much better product if more flexible and lengthen at least another inches
was a good read but was not as deep as i was expecting it to be considering the topic
it was a nice story but took a long time and repititous writing to make it to the end . thanks .
strange categories but fun . not sure where the answers come from . could be faster . but overall a fun game .

magnets are not very strong .
set them up is pain .
but be shure to havea stick because drawing withyour fingers is not that good . give it a tray
i don't think it is able to break the glass of the car , i think it is weak .
good for a primer on the idea of incorporation and its benefits , but by now it is somewhat aged .
it's a cute watch . my god son loves it . the only drawback is the watch band that is too loose .
it was a story where you knew where the to keep you reading story was going . nothing special about the story
but . my desktop does not have a disk drive and i could not find the drivers any where online
it's too large for me , i like the beads but i will need to restring it to fit my wrist .
love this jumpsuit with the back out . made too small . paid . to send back wish it did fit . sorryy .
it does give you the temp . as it should . it's not fancy , but it works for what i need it for .
i really didn't like the book the book that much because the heroine seemed to be a feminist .
the charger is ok , but it feels very breakable . also , it charged very slowly due to the low power output
no hdmi
i was expecting more from this product after reading the reviews but was disappointed as it wasn't extraordinary at all .
the toner for my printer canon image mf dw was ok . i did return the previous ordered compatable laser tonersebastiano franceschino
product was advertised as mah battery but seems to be just a mah battery with a mah label . buyer beware .
this game is fun . kinect control is still not very smooth or responsive to what you see on the scene .
the colors bleed through and the cards are thin , but this is line with other reviews . they satisfy our needs .
haven't had to use the warranty . will write more if i do ever use it . cost was relatively inexpensive also

hey i think baby adopter is boring ! ! there is nothing to do but feed and there are no changes !
this was a pretty good book but some of the stories really didn't make any sense but it was ok
the antennae is in the cord . needs a better headset . great size for exercising , just clips on to your shirt .
a little on the small side but i am going to make it work . i think it is going work .
definitely cut small . the glitter is not put on correctly , and ended up all over me , and everywhere i went .
cranks easy seems sturdy , but the wheel doesn't turn very well when rolling , maybe if i adjust my tongue weight .
the boot fits great however the heel was loose . it's an easy fix so it's not worth returning or exchanging .
usually the pilates dvd's that i have purchased were too easy . not this one . wow , this workout is tough .
very flimsy . i wish it was more sturdy . the bags are of nice quality though .
these are not deluxe but they do the job . i really don't have any more words , just wanted to star .

my students enjoyed learning how the sound effects were made but the rest of the movie was fairly boring . alright .
the cable tester works ok , but don't leave the battery in it when not using it for a long time .
it appeared that no matter which line you read , the recommended glasses rx was the same . that cannot be possible .
i was surprised it came already made , it is also smaller than some of our other mini builds . its cute
great scarf , appears to be quality , just not as long as i expected . still looks warm however . would buy again
i do like the mask , howee it is unwearable . it is too big , and the color is off . thank you
this really feels good and is very warm . but it is really so narrow and tiny , you can hardly cover anything .
thank you for having this available for purchase . this product was installed with no problems . the leds are pretty bright .
but experienced golfers might need a little more . very easy read !
good item
the description here is wrong . this is not compatible with . you must get the t b for the epson .

it is exactly how i imagined it . a beautiful replica of davy jones's chest key .
great movie , even though it left out a excessive amount of scenes and dialog .
i find it awkward to use . i guess it would be useful to some people . it works .

the cat loves it . great concept . works but the cat distrys it in a month by chewing on it . bc
my year old grandson and i enjoy playing this together and are looking forward to many hours of entertainment .
love the game but it keeps freezing my kindle fire ! the graphics are dreamy and the game is very relaxing .
it can be difficult to hear even when the volume is turned all the way up .
this product kept the water cold clean tasting , but it was very noisy when you drank the water .
i like but the yellow is very bad ! it's a very low color other then that fits the phone good .
worked great for months ! until the plastic strap broke off the buckles . now i keep it in my desk .
being irish i found this a bit too arra begorra to be realistic . it was amusing and lightly entertaining though .
it's okay , much more plastic ey than i expected . still , looks good from afar . screen saver was useless , would not adhere .
very nice but much smaller than i expected . it is for a young girl and seems very fragile and tiny !
shipped fast . hooks are kinda cheap .
definitely not high end but well worth the price so far .
its ok just wish you didnt have to pay money to get anywhere in these games absolutely drives me crazy
my son is reading this between books and says its a good story .
okay the first couple days , not really feeling it any more after week of use
i would have been interested in purchasing this book for my kindle , but not at this price . ridiculous !
not that much variety , a few good recipes but alot of redundancy
hard to get into , once you do it's really good . kinda different ending , makes me want to see the movie
fast paced , and a good read . has a lot of interesting details of police work and illusionist tricks . characters are sympathetic .
not very absorbant but cute .
for what is in this product the cost is far too high . most other types of filters are very inexpensive .
worked okay probably not for our area . was fun trying it out the kids had fun using it !
these were ok , nothing to get excited about . have had better . wont buy them again . average taste , taste was pretty bland .
bright colors but sorta cheaply made . it works though ! i like the purple and leopard . very stylish , flashy and hip !
i bought this item thinking it would cut really close . i didn't and for that reason i'm disappointed . axel
this resembles way too much old new wave stalwarts talking heads but in a rather unimaginative way .
the product is only half bottle and it feels just so so . and i'm a little disappointed with the product .
it can get a bit boring but it's ok for something different . i think it could be better with work
love penelope keith in other things but this was not the greatest . funny british politics but need more character development
tables but there were several missing pieces to the stand . a little over priced for just tables .
everything inside looks like toys , i don't know if they'll help but it's good to have something better than nothing .
it is very soothing and fresh , but it does not clean as well as some other toner i used before .
an good guide to studying the bible . professionally written , very interesting and informative book . the subject matter was covered very thoroughly .
didn't expect much for this price either .
did not like it as much as firefly . don't feel a connection to the characters nor storyline . some entertainment value .
smells funny but is still adorable . got it for my special someone who now has it on their keychain
this memoir was purchased for my daughter for a project in school it arrived on time and served its purpose
the case was fine . however our camera did not fit . i do not know if i read the measurements wrong .
lacks some basic detail i need . could not complete the tests in the early chapters . needed more dos coding help .
they need to be altered before i can wear them and the color is very bright . i will give them away .
it did not grab my attention , but it was something enjoyable to read while waiting for my daughter at dance .
i was hoping for a more bolder imprint to be on the stamping . it's still a good product to use .
i have not try it cause it like lime powder . the transport is very fast and quite a big bottle .
on a few exceptions , it is a typical woody allen movie . boring . hannah and her sisters is a more interesting movie !
. considered , concise , and a conflagration of art , exceeding its grasp . a lovely light of feelings love , loyalty , friendship , loss , longing , satisfaction
wick is hard to light after initial lighting . it does smell nice but i wish it was a stronger scent .
i thought the pens would be pen length and yet they appear shorter than the little pictures that were shown
i enjoyed reading the the book but it ended like their maybe a follow up to this one . is their ? maybe .
it was a little boring . i could not get into the story , skipped around and then finally read the end .
love the product , but this is a horrible price .
it seems to be not as high quality that i thought it would be , and doesn't work for light breezes .
this looks like a good idea . but i find i do not use it very often because of it's size .
keeps that soul in your playing as only rev . gary can do with his earthy ways of going a statement !
looks less great in the flesh like so many things .
enjoyed the politics of the families . had some difficulty following the characters as the are called so many different names .
the book does not grab you to want to read it all the way to the end in one sitting .
