i can't figure out how it works so i bought a wireless webcam instead . sorry , i can't figure it out .
i didnt like this product . it would fall apart after a couple of daysplastics wasnt good at all
in spite of its many favorable reviews , i was bored by this tired tale of humans hunting humans for entertainment .
i need good shoes due to diabetes and these were stiff and cheap materials . i will not buy crocs again .
the cookie cut outs make the cookies too small making it hard to decorate once they are done . skip it !
will ship back did not fit this why i gave a poor rating loved the other pair fit was great
is not high output , . amps . slow shipping .
a person really misses that personal touch because they probably would have realized a side mount was not even close
could not find the type of music i like , and too hard to understand search .
i dont listen to music because music is generally unappealing to me and have no reason to listen to it .
no drama , predictable , unbelievable , gratuitous violence . the actors walked through their roles . this isn't a goodfellas by any means .
i understand this is an account of one woman's life with bi polar , but unfortunately seems to be her favorite word .
i didn't care for it much . after the first few games i was bored . i deleted it from my phone .
quite crude , cheesy production and painting . not depicting the ae panda treuno well at all . quite disappointed and not recommending to anyone .
it didn't fit and it cost too much to send back it is more than i paid for the case
didn't match up to lucky's strong character and left her at a wedding to a dork without a future . dumb .
it didn't have the pocket , it was too thin and too short . don't order this it doesn't fit . poor quality
here's what is thought about you . it's a open expression . i'll waste . to keep fools out of my life . easy
not as big as i was hoping and does not hold heat as well as the graphite crucible do .
this game is simplistic and boring . no challenge . it was free , but it was still too expensive . you shouldn't bother .

this product felll apart after a few uses . the thin blue srtip separated from the white case . would not reccomend

hard to play with the iffy controls . need better response or it is a waste of time downloading this game .
the picture would indicate that this doesn't fit in my ford expedition ? anymore pictures available ?
